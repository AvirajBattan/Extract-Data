SENTENCES AND THEIR PERPLEXITY   
 it exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much the same criticisms
 the treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point
 there are more stems per item in athabascan which expresses the fact that the athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in diverging from proto-athabascan than the yokuts languages from proto-yokuts
 this may be because the athabascan divergence began earlier; or again because the athabascan languages spread over a very much larger territory; or both
 the differentiation however is not very much greater as shown by the fact that athabascan shows 3
 46 stems per meaning slot as against 2
 75 for yokuts with a slightly greater number of languages represented in our sample: 24 as against 21
 46 the stemitem rate becomes 3
 75 in equivalent number these general facts are mentioned to make clear that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant comparison
 the greatest difference in the two sets of figures is due to differences in the two sets of lists used
 these differences in turn result from the fact that my yokuts vocabularies were built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of english meaning between illiterate informants and myself within a compact and uniform territorial area but that hoijer's vocabulary is based on swadesh's second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating all items which might be culturally or geographically determined
 swadesh in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal; i one that was specifically adapted to the san joaquin valley 6
 the result is that i included 70 animal names but swadesh only 4; and somewhat similarly for plants 16 as against 4
 swadesh and therefore hoijer felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts 6
 the groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as in size
 other classes are included only by myself or only by swadesh and hoijer
 what we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes: body parts and products which with a proportionally nearly even representation come out with nearly even ratios; 2
 7; nature ratios 3
 1; ratios 3
 7; ratios 4
 4
 it will be seen that where the scope is similar the athabascan ratios come out somewhat higher except for verbs where alone the athabascan ratio is lower
 this exception may be connected with hoijer's use of a much higher percentage of verbs: 22% of his total list as against 3 5
 or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the athabascan verb
 more word class ratios determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the question
 if word classes differ in their resistance or liability to stem replacement within meaning slot it is conceivable that individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually 7
 hoijer's athabascan and my yokuts share 71 identical meanings allowance for several near-synonyms like stomach-belly big-large 
 for yokuts i tabulated these 71 items in five columns according as they were expressed by 1 2 3 4 and more than 4 stems
 the totals for these five categories are not too uneven namely 20 15 11 16 9 respectively
 for athabascan with a greater range of stems the first two of five corresponding columns were identical 1 and 2 stems; the three others had to be spread somewhat and are headed respectively f; f; and f stems
 while the particular limits of these groupings may seem artificially arbitrary; they do fairly express a corresponding grouping of more variable material and they eventuate also in five classes along a similar scale containing approximately equal numbers of cases namely 19 14 15 11 12 in athabascan
 when now we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing in the same column or grade or one column or grade apart or two or three or four we find these differences: f   this distribution can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart: f; which divided by f gives a mean of 1
 if the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families the distance would of course be 0
 if it were wholly random and unrelated it would be 2 16
 0 assuming the five classes were equal in n which approximately they are
 the actual mean of 1
 07 being about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2 6
 0 of no correlation it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual items of meaning as regards long-term stem displacement
 in 1960 david d thomas published basic vocabulary in some mon-khmer languages which compares 8 mon-khmer languages with the i- e language data on which swadesh based the revised retention rate and his revised 100 word basic glottochronological list in towards greater accuracy h 
 thomas' findings are first that the individual items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence; but second that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence first conclusion on behavior of individual items is negative whereas mine was partially positive
 his second conclusion on semantic word classes agrees with mine 7
 this second conclusion independently arrived at by independent stud y of material from two pairs of language families as different and remote from one another as these four are cannot be ignored
 thomas also presents a simple equation for deriving an index of persistence which weights not only the number of stems per meaning but their relative frequency
 thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per meaning is: stem identical in 8 languages 100%; stem frequencies 7 and 1 86%; stem frequencies 4 and 4 64%; stem frequencies 4 3 and 1 57% 6
 his formula will have to be weighed may be altered or improved and it should be tested on additional bodies of material 7
 but consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations with diachronic and classificatory relevance; and gleason presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area 7
 as to relative frequencies of competing roo ts thomas with his 'weighting' seems to be the first to have considered the significance this might have
 the problem needs further exploration
 i was at least conscious of the distinction in my full yokuts presentation that awaits publication in which in listing 'two-stem meanings' i set off by asterisks those forms in which n of stem b was f of stem a3 the unasterisked ones standing for f; or under 'four stems' i set off by asterisks cases where the combined n of stems f was f
 these findings and others which will in time be developed will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry
 if adjectival meanings show relatively low retentiveness of stems as i am confident will prove to be the case in most languages of the world why should our basic lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms but only 8 per cent of animals and plants which replace much more slowly? 6
  had hoijer substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of athabascan language separation smaller
 and irrespective of the outcome in centuries elapsed since splitting calculations obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable units than with variously unstable ones
 it is evident that swadesh has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior of lexical items 8
 why then this urge to include unstable items in his basic list? 7
  it is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical and cultural conditioning as possible
 and why that insistence? 14
  it is the hope of attaining a list of items of universal occurrence
 but it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is a snare
 not that such a list cannot be constructed; but the nearer it comes to attaining universality the less significant will it be linguistically
 its terms will tend to be labile or vague and they will fit actual languages more and more badly
 the practical operational problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison
 the most important quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as possible
 in proportion as meanings are concrete we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive
 an elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious common-sense indubitable identity as do an eye or tooth or nail
 they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence; and they should be given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these qualities 7
 with the universal list as his weapon swadesh has extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past eight ten twelve millennia back
 and he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation between all western hemisphere languages
 some of this may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence 6
 but the farther out he moves the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence and the larger the speculative component in his inferences
 he has traversed provinces and kingdoms but he has not consolidated them behind him nor does he control them 7
 he has announced results on hokan penutian uto-aztecan and almost all other american families and phyla and has diagrammed their degree of interrelation; but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other than salish
 the remote cloudy possible has values of its own- values of scope stimulus potential and imagination
 but there is also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics: the aspect of learning the internal organization of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more remote and elusive external links; of classification first with elapsed age merely a by-product; of acquiring evidential knowledge of what happened in athabascan in yokuts in uto-aztecan in the last few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them
 this involves step- by-step progress and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing body of scientific inquiry
 if of the founders of glottochronology swadesh has escaped our steady plodding and lees has repudiated his own share in the founding that is no reason why we should swerve
 there is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by swadesh's rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown so vast
 it seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble solid and limited basis 9
 i would propose first an abandonment of attempts at a universal lexical list as intrinsically unachievable and operationally inadequate in proportion as it is achieved
 i would propose next as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible
 there would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable 8
 an attempted middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word was selected 7
 doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should arise about the methods for applying these policies
 it was neverthele ss almost incredible that four years after yalta there should be a complete split over germany with hot heads on both sides planning to use the germans against their former allies and with nazi-minded germans expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the other
 when the yalta conference opened the american policy of postponing all discussion of russia's western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down
 starting in great force late in december from a line stretching from east prussia to budapest the red armies had swept two hundred miles across poland to the oder thirty miles from berlin and the upper danube region was being rapidly overrun while the western allies had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the rhine 5
 the long delay in opening the second front was now working to russia's advantage
 the west was now glad to propose the 1919 curzon line which was substantially russia's 1941 border as the boundary between russia and poland
 when this proposal was made stalin spoke with stronger emotion than at any other time during the conference
 he stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject 10
 the bitter memory of russia's exclusion from the paris peace conference and of the west's effort to stamp out bolshevism at its birth boiled up within him
 you would drive us into shame he declared
 the white russians and the ukrainians would say that stalin and molotov were far less reliable defenders of russia than curzon and clemenceau
 yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accepted the curzon line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of poland in some regions 7
 he did not mind the line itself which churchill declared in the house of commons on february 27 1945 he had always believed to be just and right but he did not want it called by a hated name 7
 the west had long since forgotten the events of 1919 but it was not so easy for the red leaders who felt that they had suffered great injustice in that period
 in the dunn-atherton memorandum of february 4 1942 the state department had expected to be able to hold russia in check by withholding agreement to her 1941 boundaries
 now stalin made it clear that he meant to move poland's western borders deep into germany back to the western neisse-oder river lines taking not only east prussia and all of silesia but pomerania and the tip of brandenburg back to and including stettin 6
 from six to nine million additional germans would be evicted though most would have fled and poland would receive far more from germany than the poor territories including the great pripet marshes which she lost to russia
 stalin declared that he preferred to continue the war a little longer although it costs us blood in order to give poland compensation in the west at the expense of the germans
 by this time churchill was not so cordial toward moving poland westward as he had been at teheran where he and eden had both heartily approved the idea
 after a prolonged study of the oder line on a map at teheran churchill liked the picture
 he would tell the poles he said that they had been given a fine place to live in more than three hundred miles each way
 at yalta he thought more about the six million germans who would have to leave trying to find work in germany and roosevelt objected to the western neisse river being chosen in the south instead of the eastern neisse both of which flow into the oder
 the issue was left in abeyance presumably for the peace conference
 however there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued by large minorities of germans or russians
 the moving of millions of the german master-race from the very heart of junkerdom to make room for the polish slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate was a drastic operation but there was little doubt that it was historically justified 5
 of more importance to the west than poland's boundaries was the character of her government
 at yalta the west still believed that eastern europe could be kept in its orbit in spite of the onrushing soviet armies 6
 though little democracy had ever been practised in this region and much of it was still ruled by feudalistic means it was taken for granted that at least the forms of western democracy would be established in this area and western capitalism preserved within it 5
 believing devoutly as they did in anglo-saxon institutions it was important to both roosevelt and churchill that the poles should have them
 the issue was acute because the exiled polish government in london supported in the main by britain was still competing with the new lublin government formed behind the red army
 more time was spent in trying to marry these imcompatibles than over any subject discussed at yalta
 the result was an agreement that the lublin government should be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from poland itself and from the poles abroad and pledged to hold free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballo t
 all democratic and anti-nazi parties were to have the right to campaign
 roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this issue 9
 it was a matter of principle with churchill since britain had declared war in behalf of poland
 to stalin it was a matter of life and death
 he made this completely clear
 speaking with great earnestness he said: for the russian people the question of poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security
 throughout history poland has been the corridor through which the enemy has passed into russia
 twice in the last thirty years our enemies the germans have passed through this corridor
 it is in russia's interest that poland should be strong and powerful in a position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force h
 it is necessary that poland should be free independent in power 8
 therefore it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the soviet state
 in other words the soviet union was determined to create a poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against germany and so closely tied to russia that there would never be any question of her serving as a cordon sanitaire against the soviets or posing as an independent balancing power in between russia and germany 8
 byrnes says that invariably thereafter the soviets used the same security argument to justify their course in poland
 this reasoning was also as inevitable as anything could be 10
 any free elections that were to be held in poland would have to produce a government in which moscow had complete confidence and all pressure from the west for free voting by anti-soviet elements in poland would be met by restrictions on voting by these elements 5
 in even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of eastern europe where the upper classes had generally collaborated with the nazis even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into russia as a part of hitler's armies
 but at yalta the conflicting expectations of east and west were merged into an agreement by the big three to assist all liberated countries in europe to create democratic institutions of their own choice
 in any case where in their judgment conditions require italics added they would form interim governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive to the will of the people
 other similar affirmations in the declaration on liberated europe seemed to assure democratic institutions on the western model 5
 later it developed that the soviets had a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discussed later and their judgment never told them that the big three should unite in establishing democratic conditions as we understand them within their zone of influence
 professor mcneill thinks that at yalta stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him that he thought the exclusion of the anti-soviet voters from east european elections would not be greatly resented by his allies while neither roosevelt nor churchill frankly faced the fact that in poland at least genuinely free democratic elections would return governments unfriendly to russia by any definition of international friendliness
 also war-time propaganda and cooperation had obscured the differences between russian and western ideas of democracy and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil the military victories over germany and japan
 the application of these formulae could not please both sides for they really attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable 5
 while obliged to concede governments in east europe allied with the soviet union instead of opposed to it we thought we had preserved our social and economic system in east europe
 this illusion was described in a far-sighted editorial in the new york herald tribune on march 5 1947 in connection with the submission of the satellite peace treaties to the senate
 in doing so marshall and byrnes were asking for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international life 10
 we had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory automatically establishing our system throughout the world 7
 we were troubled about the fate of the baltic states 9
 yalta left us with comforting illusions of a western capitalist-democratic political economy reigning supreme up to the curzon line and the borders of bessarabia
 this is a penetrating description of our post-war illusion which applied to other areas than east europe
 the same editorial continued that we expected to democrati ze japan and korea and to see a new china pattern itself easily on our institutions
 we expected in short that most of the world would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple from such a position to deal with the localized aberrations of the soviet union 10
 yet actually the image corresponded in no way to the actualities of the post-war world
 neither our military our economic nor our ideological power reached far enough to determine the fate of east europe 7
 then the editorial added prophetically: how far they may reach in asia is yet undetermined but they fall far short of our dreams of the war conferences
 here is the best short explanation of the origins of the cold war that has been written
 failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite treaties president truman re-declared the cold war on march 12 1947 in the truman doctrine exactly one week after the herald tribune editorial was written and a year after the cold war had been announced by churchill at fulton missouri in truman's presence 5
 then china promptly went communist and mr truman had to fight the interminable korean war for the democratization of korea before we learned how far our writ did reach in asia
 years of war strain and hatred; of heavy arms expenditures and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the united states could bring itself to accept the two chief results of world a while the cold war raged it was easy to blame it all on yalta
 yet in summarizing a series of careful essays on the yalta conference forrest pogue could find no basis for yalta becoming a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponents of roosevelt and international cooperation
 when the yalta papers were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal by anyone
 an analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts 11
 first is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation planning and discussion
 preparation began slightly more than a year after independence with the first steps to organize rural communes
 all political interests supported electoral planning although there are some signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to some procrastination
 the second major aspect of the election is the actual procedure of registration nomination and voting
 considerable technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was generally above reproach
 however the regionally differentiated results which appear below in tables are interesting evidence of the problems of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances
 a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy is the results of the election
 the electoral procedure prevented the ready identification of party affiliation but all vitally interested parties including the government itself were busily engaged in determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the month following the elections 6
 the fourth and concluding point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics
 elections have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence
 they were stressed in the speeches of si mubarak bekkai when the first council of ministers was formed and again when the istiqlal took a leading role in the second council
 king muhammad 5 was known to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections on may day 1957
 there followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957 in which it appears that the minister of the interior took the most pessimistic view and that the istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic
 since the complicated process of establishing new communes and reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the french did not even begin until the fall of 1957 this goal appears somewhat ambitious 7
 from the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues in moroccan politics precisely the type of questions that were most difficult to resolve in the new government 5
 until the charter of liberties was issued in the fall of 1958 there were no guarantees of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes
 the istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 but the pdi the most important minor party at the time objected to the istiqlal's predominance in the civil service and influence in radio maroc 5
 there were rumors that the ministry of the interior favored an arbitrary non-political process which were indirectly affirmed when the king personally intervened in the planned meetings 9
 the day following his intervention the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that h the possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral lists lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation itself h would be supported by the king himself
 the ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration of elections but french consultants were called in and notices of further investigation appeared from time to time
 in january 1958 the minister of the interior announced that an election law was ready to be submitted to the king the rumors of election dates appeared once again first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer
 although the government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958 the first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied
 in late 1957 the mp appeared and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the istiqlal was revealed when the third council of government under balafrej was formed without support from progressive elements in the party
 the parties were on the whole unprepared for elections while the people were still experiencing post-independence let-down and suffering the after effects of poor harvests in 1957
 despite the internal and international crises that harassed morocco the elections remained a central issue
 they figured prominently in the balafrej government of may 1958 which the king was reportedly determined to keep in office until elections could be held
 but the eagerly sought homogeneity of the balafrej council of government was never achieved as the istiqlal quarreled over foreign policy labor politics and economic development
 by december 1958 when 'abdallah ibrahim became president of the council elections had even greater importance
 they were increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural communes as the focus of a new constructive national effort 7
 to minimize the chances of repeating the balafrej debacle the ibrahim government was formed a titre personnel and a special office was created in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the elections
 by this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete
 there remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws through the labyrinth of palace politics and making a small number of policy decisions
 from the rather tortuous history of electoral planning in morocco an important point emerges concerning the first elections in a developing country and evaluating their results
 in the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving fundamental and sometimes bitter differences among leaders and also as a source of policy guidance
 in the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections will give them new prominence but in a system where there is as yet no place for the less prominent
 lacking the respected and effective institutions that consensus helps provide minority parties such as the pdi in 1957 and the progressive istiqlal faction in 1958 clamor for elections when out of power but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power
 those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process
 the tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest rather than an instrument of national interest had two important effects on electoral planning in morocco
 at the central level the scrutin uninominal voting system was selected over some form of the scrutin de liste system even though the latter had been recommended by duverger and favored by all political parties
 the choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas of the country but it also served to minimize the national political value of the elections
 although the elections were for local officials it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties from publicly identifying their candidates
 with multiple member districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to state their positions more clearly 7
 both parties and the ministry of the interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth the political affiliations of the successful candidates and thereby give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political significance
 since a national interpretation cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation
 the general setting of the moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization
 the concentration of effective power in rabat leads not only to party bickering but to distraction from local activity that might have had many auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections
 interesting evidence can be found in the results of the chamber of commerce elections which took place three weeks before national elections
 the istiqlal sponsored umcia was opposed by candidates of the new unfp in nearly all urban centers
 as the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy businessmen the umcia was generally favored against the more progressive labor-based unfp the newer party campaigned heavily while the older more confident party expected the moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them as they had done for many years 4
 the local istiqlal and umcia offices did not campaign and lost heavily
 the value of the elections was lost both as an experiment in increased political participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest as shown in table 1
 the chamber of commerce elections were of course an important event in the preparation for rural commune elections
 the unfp learned that its urban organization which depends heavily on umt support was most effective
 the istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete precise problems of internal politics
 the overall effect was probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than might have otherwise taken place 5
 a second major point of this essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections
 although a somewhat technical subject it has important political implications as the above discussion of the voting system indicated 5
 furthermore the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential to evaluating election results
 the sine qua non of the elections was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure
 as the background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer elections
 the pdi and later the popular movement protected the istiqlal's privileged position until the fall of balafrej and then the istiqlal used the same argument which it had previously ignored against the pro-unfp tendencies of the ibrahim government
 the bulk of the preparation had of course proceeded under the supervision of the ministry of the interior whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics
 apart from some areas of recurring trouble like bani mellal where inexperienced officials had been appointed there is little evidence that local officials intervened in the electoral process
 centrally however the administrative problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very like ly an unfair advantage 6
 the king decided to remove ibrahim a week before elections and to institute a non-party council of government under his personal direction
 although the monarch had frequently asserted that the elections were to be without party significance his action was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor
 the new council was itself inescapably of political meaning which was most clearly revealed in the absence of any unfp members and the presence of several istiqlal leaders
 since the details of the elections were settled the change of government had no direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections and may have been more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the unfp voting preparations began in the fall of 1959 although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes was completed in 1958
 there were three major administrative tasks: the fixing of electoral districts the registration of voters and the registration of candidates
 voter registration began in late november 1959 and continued until early january 1960
 the government was most anxious that there be a respectable response
 periodic bulletins of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial officials
 a goal was fixed as given in table 2 and attention focused on its fulfillment
 the qualifications to vote were kept very simple 9
 both men and women of twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof of residence and identification 6
 there were liberal provisions for dispensation where documents or records were lacking
 the police were disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens crimina ls and those punished for protectorate activities
 the registration figures given in table 2 must be interpreted with caution since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit of a reliable census
 unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future 5
 some vocational training schools provide such training but the current need exceeds the facilities
 the present federal program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of the smith-hughes act which provided a continuing annual appropriation of $7 million to support on a matching basis state-administered programs of vocational education in agriculture trades industrial skills and home economics
 since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts have extended this federal program
 the george-barden act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to $29 million in addition to the $7 million under the smith act
 the health amendment act of 1956 added $5 million for practical nurse training
 the latest major change in this program was introduced by the national defense education act of 1958 title 8 of which amended the george-barden act
 annual authorizations of $15 million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national defense needs for highly skilled technicians
 the federal program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education programs in public schools
 the initiative administration and control remain primarily with the local school districts
 even the states remain primarily in an assisting role providing leadership and teacher training
 federal assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure and the state or local districts must pay at least half 7
 the state may decide to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it
 throughout the history of the program state government expenditures in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the federal expenditures while local districts all together have spent more than either federal or state governments
 today federal funds account for only one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education
 the greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough to obtain their full allocation of outside funds 6
 national defense considerations have been the major reason behind most federal training expenditures in recent decades 6
 during world war 2 about 7
 5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special programs administered by state and local school authorities: vocational education for national defense and war production training
 the total cost of the five-year program was $297 million 14
 for the smith-hughes george-barden and national defense act of 1958 the cumulative total of federal expenditures in 42 years was only about $740 million
 no comparable measures are available of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education training 8
 there are a great number and variety of private commercial schools trade schools and technical schools
 in addition many large corporations operate their own formal training programs
 a recent study indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations
 most skilled industrial workers nevertheless still acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions
 the national manpower council of columbia university has estimated that three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have not been formally trained
 there is little doubt that the students benefit from vocational education
 employers prefer to hire youth with such training rather than those without and most graduates of vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training
 vocational educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled workers but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills
 in most states trade and industrial training is provided in a minority of the high schools usually located in the larger cities 7
 in arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade and industrial courses
 in illinois about 13 per cent of the schools have programs and in pennsylvania 11 per cent
 an important recent trend is the development of area vocational schools
 for a number of years kentucky louisiana and several other states have been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve nearby school districts in several counties
 these schools are intended to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not be possible for very small school districts
 transportation may be provided from nearby school districts 7
 courses are provided mainly for post high school day programs; but sometimes arrangements also are made for high school students to attend and evening extension courses also may be conducted 6
 the title 8 program of the national defense education act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward area schools 7
 by 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states 10
 they were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor areas
 an extension of this program into relation to new some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their desire to attract new industry
 the major training need of a new industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a large number of semi-skilled machine operators
 a few key skilled workers experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought in with the plant manager or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere
 a prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees
 the existence of a public school vocational training program in trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled
 additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities staff and program are in being
 thus besides the training provided to youth in school the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development efforts 7
 few states make effective use of their existing vocational education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new industry
 the opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their vocational education funds to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be quickly local focus the major weakness of vocational training programs in labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands
 this weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas for it is inherent in the system of local school districts in this country 6
 planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to local employer needs for trained workers
 all the manuals for setting up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a local survey of skill needs of estimating the growth of local jobs and of consulting with local employers on the types of courses and their content
 furthermore there is a cautious conservatism on the part of those making local skill surveys
 local jobs can be seen and counted while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical
 while the u s department of labor has a program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and publishing current outlook statements there is little tangible evidence that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum planning 9
 the u s office of education continues to stress local surveys rather than national surveys
 this procedure is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history of declining employment
 elaborate studies have been made in labor surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify training programs for those skills
 no effort is made in the same studies to present information on regional or national demand trends in these skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be trained 7
 moreover the current information on what types of training are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary
 there simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that are in demand and the types of training programs that are required or most suitable
 much of the available information comes not from the federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states 7
 state and local agencies in the vocational education field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities 8
 there is a need for an expanded federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education departments and local school boards in existing programs
 a related question is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided
 there is little evidence that existing public or private training programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in their programs even though they must pay tuition receive no subsistence payments and are not guaranteed a job
 however there always is some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire training
 again one major difficulty is the local focus
 a training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwar ds and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely at jobs in the local community
 if there is adequate information on job opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere many more workers can be expected to respond 9
 another problem is who will pay for the training 10
 local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training
 programs usually are expanded only when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand it
 even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it
 state governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational schools but their focus is still on area job opportunities 7
 only the federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower needs
 if only state funds were used to pay for the vocational education it could be argued that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in other states 10
 however if federal funds are used it would be entirely appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment
 such training would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find jobs in other localities
 a further possibility is suggested by the example of the g i bills and also by some recent trends in attitudes toward improving college education: that is to provide financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local facilities are inadequate 5
 this probably would require some support for subsistence as well as for tuition but the total would be no greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a youth conservation corps 7
 a maximum of $600 per year per student would enable many to take training away from home
 a program of financial assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest in training highly skilled labor
 instead of being limited to the poor training facilities in remote areas the student would be able to move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training
 such specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly growing industries where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunities are located
 this would heighten possibilities for part-time cooperative on-the-job and extension training
 personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual
 his aptitudes and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper training
 but briefly the topping configuration must be examined for its inferences
 then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had further forecasting significance
 and then the application of the count rules to the width of the configuration give us an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline
 the very idea of their being count rules implies that there is some sort of proportion to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway movement 7
 this expectation is what really sold point and figure 10
 but there is no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense
 experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply and in fine these merely dwell upon a relationship between th e durations and intensities of events
 after all too much does not happen too suddenly nor does very little take long
 the advantages and disadvantages of these two types of charting bar charting and point and figure charting remain the subject of fairly good natured litigation among their respective professional advocates with both methods enjoying in common one irrevocable merit 6
 they are both trend-following methods
 even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum the odds still favor them both for the trend in effect is always more likely to continue than to reverse
 of course many more things are charted besides prices 10
 the foregoing have been methods of charting prices but now let us look at some of the other indices that are customarily charted and which are looked to for their forecasting abilities
 the search for forecasting formulae is ceaseless 11
 correlations have been worked up between the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price
 the theory behind this is of course fundamentalist in character 9
 as the number of reported freight car loadings increased this was taken to indicate increased industrial activity and consequently increased stock earnings implying fatter dividends and implying therefore increased stock market prices
 we now know that things rarely ever work out in such cut-and-dried fashion and that car loadings while perhaps interesting enough are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock prices turn
 but the quest for such an index goes on ceaselessly with all manner of investors and speculators participating ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the proverbial shoe-string operator all seeking doggedly studiously daily- and often nightly- for the enchanting index that will foretell the eternal secret: which way will the market move; up or down? 6
  it recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth a quest heavily invested in during the days of wooden ships 5
 just as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who carry on the quest for the enchanting index
 much of this goes on in offices high up in wall street's lofty wind-swept towers
 there sit men who make moving averages of weekly volume monthly averages of price-earnings ratios ratios of the number of advances to the number of declines ratios of an individual stock's performance to overall market performance ratios of rising price volume to falling price volume odd-lot indices and what not
 they are concerned with all things traded in securities bonds cocao coffee soybeans cotton tin oats etc
 and along chicago's west jackson boulevard la salle street and around the merchandise mart plaza there sit men who chart crop reports who divide the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs and the number of hogs by the amount of corn 7
 they plot the open interest curves rainfall curves and they even divide democratic congressmen by republican congressmen 6
 all these things and countless more enter into their calculations and yet the enchanting index remains non-forthcoming 9
 not at any rate in the fuller sense of the word
 the markets are far too subtle and the last word in these endeavors will doubtless never be written for the enchanting index is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth
 but whereas civilized men no longer pursue the fountain they never abandoned their pursuit of the enchanting index
 we mentioned odd-lot indices a few paragraphs ago 12
 in the stock market the normal trading package is a hundred shares just as 5000 bushels is the standard grain contract package 7
 a stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange 10
 this results in a separate record being made distinguishing these trades from the overall volume of trading
 according to the theory underlying odd-lot indices the trader who trades odd lots is most likely a small trader one who can't afford to trade round lots
 or to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast they represent a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders
 falling most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this rank of traders can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd-lot traders do marketwise is taken to exemplify the wrong thing to do 5
 figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers 6
 odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their particular statistical recipe
 they might for example plot it exactly as is or they might make ten day moving averages of it or longer moving averages or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases to odd-lot sales 5
 the particular recipe is a matter of individual taste 14
 the data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price chart usually of a popular stock average
 towards the end of an intermediate or major rise while the top is forming on the price chart it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply
 this warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite likely to be a top
 similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while the bottom is being formed on the price chart it is characteristic that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood
 thus in the aggregate the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the bottoms notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions
 while it had long been known in general that the public is always wrong the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical basis
 one might well wonder why the public is always wrong and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned with the chicken and the egg
 which came first? 16
  is it really that the public buys at the tops and not that the market tops out when the public buys? 7
  and the converse at bottoms
 does the public usually sell at bottoms or does the market usually bottom out when the public sells? 7
    we have been using the word public in quotation marks that is in its vernacular connotation with reference to the odd-lot index theory
 obviously someone has to sell in order for someone to buy and vice versa
 and while all concerned are members of the literal public somewhat less than all concerned although still a majority form the quotation marked public
 and the public minus the public leaves the so-called sophisticated element- the element on the other end of the public's transactions
 this element is often called strong hands
 strong hands differ from weak hands in that their operations are the primary movers
 they initiate campaigns so to speak even if this initiation is diffused among them and their concerted action only psychologically organized
 strong hands act; weak hands react
 strong hands move first; weak hands ask what is going on? 8
  when strong hands buy they are able to buy more and they do it even in the face of bearish news reports
 they are able to sit more patiently with what they have bought 15
 needless to say strong hands are not eager to be joined by weak hands for this increases the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up at higher prices during the run-up phase of the campaign
 certain badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there is something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive forces
 but after all can anyone imagine a market wherein the reverse of these things were true? 7
  try to imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose and the majority would make consistent profits 7
 how much and how many profits could a majority take out of the losses of a few? 8
    moreover the taunt concerning the sophisticated echelon and its alleged erudition is put to test during every campaign and accrues only upon results; not before
 it quite often happens that campaigns go askew resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands into played-out hands just as a member of a former campaign's public may emerge flatteringly right the next time
 membership in the echelons fluctuates too
 the study of odd-lot indices is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow what with all observers trying to get on the side of the few at the same time
 the usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis as well declines in direct proportion to the dissemination of its use 8
 it has to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word few
 diametric opposition must persist as to the future course of prices if there is to persist a market at all
 and the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement would not support markets as we know them at all and is in fact unimaginable
 there need be no squeamishness about admitting this 13
 anyone still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what the minority loses
 mr john magee whose work has been discussed in this chapter was quoted in a new yorker magazine profile as saying- h of course you have to remember it's a good thing for us chartists that there aren't more of us
 if you got too many people investing by this method their operations would begin to affect stock prices and thus throw the charts off
 the method would become self-defeating
 mr alexander h wheelan's study helps in point and figure technique tells the readers- we assure you that the total number of people using this method of market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating in the securities and commodities markets
 what with traders trading for so many different objectives and what with there being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading techniques in use and more coming into use all the time it is hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough fans to invalidate itself
 nevertheless all theories and techniques lead but to one of two possible modes of expression if they lead to a market committment at all
 in the final analysis then the user becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance notwithstanding any amount of forethought and calculation however elaborate
 thus while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it is commonplace for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed
 though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse the possible conclusions remain but two
 the purpose set forth at the beginning of this book was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods alrea dy in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that is to follow and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead 5
 in assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961 the question as always is the prospect for general business activity
 by and large what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and will thus determine interest rates
 moreover the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal monetary and other federal policies which affect interest rates
 nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business activity
 during much of the year the general level of business activity has moved along on a record-high plateau but there have been persistent signs of slack in the economy
 the tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident
 although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year has thus far been quite modest it is hard to escape the conclusion that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat longer
 it is difficult to see any powerf ul sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust 8
 the rate of plant and equipment spending by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some decline 9
 in earlier business cycles when this occurred the country usually experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage financing became easier to obtain
 at this time however there are signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction
 these signs are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments 
 on the other hand in a more favorable vein general business activity should receive some stimulus from rising federal spending and the reduction in business inventories has probably run a good part of its course
 the 2% increase in retail sales in october to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well as the most recent consumer survey by the national industrial conference board which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans
 the pattern of general business activity which probably lies ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity gets under way 7
 the recovery will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit as well as by an expansion of government spending well sustained consumer spending and some rebuilding of business inventories
 what does the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rates in 1961? 9
  it suggests that during the next several months through the spring of 1961 the demand for long-term capital funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to move a little lower especially the rates on federal state and local bonds as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds
 however as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present as well as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters the over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high so that any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great
 it seems likely moreover that with an increase in the rate of saving in mortgage lending institutions interest rates on residential mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year although the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily in other terms than interest rate eg easier downpayment and amortization terms
 if the trend of general business activity follows the pattern suggested here we are likely to see additional steps by the federal reserve authorities to ease the availability of credit
 certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility as well as an easier reserve position for the banking system
 however the monetary authorities will continue to be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow of gold as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle 7
 one of the most intriguing questions is whether the recent departures of the federal reserve authorities from confining their open market operations to treasury bills will spread into longer-term government securities in the next few months
 to the extent that the new administration has its wishes the federal reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire maturity range of government securities and aggressively seek to force down long-term interest rates
 the principle of bills only or bills preferably seems so strongly accepted by the federal reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open market purchases regularly into long-term government securities
 however to the extent that the monetary authorities in their effort to ease credit in the next several months conduct their open market operations in longer-term government bonds they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result of market forces
 by the end of the spring of 1961 assuming that a general business recovery gets under way interest rates should begin to edge upward again depending upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to restrain credit availability
 my guess would be that interest rates will decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during the downturn 6
 it is pertinent to ask the question: has the long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about run its course and are we now entering a period in which both capital market forces and federal policies will produce a prolonged decline of interest rates? 5
  my answer is in the negative because i believe that total capital demands during the sixties will continue to press against available supplies and interest rates will generally tend to be firm at high levels
 this view is based upon several basic economic forces which i believe will be operating in recent events in the general assembly of the united nations confirm that the cold war will remain with us and probably intensify for the foreseeable future
 this makes it certain that federal expenditures for military preparedness and foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several years
 we are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the friendship of the new african nations against the ruthless competition of the communist bloc
 our efforts to overcome the lead of the russians in space are bound to mean accelerated federal spending
 moreover it is likely that federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the communist countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better than theirs will lead to rising federal spending in certain areas such as education housing medical aid and the like 5
 there are serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising federal expenditures of which i take a dim view but it seems very likely to occur
 during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping up in the rate of household formations which should contribute to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building 6
 according to the latest projections of the bureau of the census the annual rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years
 under the most favorable assumptions for increase the bureau of the census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise from about 883000 in the last two years of the fifties to an annual rate of about 1018000 in the first five years of the sixties and to a slightly higher annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the decade
 during the seventies the projections show a more pronounced rise to an annual rate of 1338000 in the second half of that decade 10
 accordingly the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the general economic prospects of the sixties
 however the impact of a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated
 the average annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1525000 in with the expansion of family formation in the sixties a continued substantial rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems to be indicated
 this is an area in which there is still a large backlog of demand 29
 state and local expenditures increased persistently from $26 11
 5-billion in 1949 to $44
 3-billion in 1959 and it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this decade which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion by 1970
 here would be a powerful force for raising business activity 11
 the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures should continue to move upward from the levels of the fifties 6
 spurred by keen competition in our industrial system and still further increases in the funds devoted to industrial research plant and equipment expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade
 i suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing which was dammed-up during the thirties and world war 2 is finally in the process of running dry
 there is some clear-cut evidence of this
 for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans for housing under the va home loan guaranty program seems to have largely exhausted itself
 indeed the failure of home-building as a whole to respond this year to somewhat greater availability of mortgage financing and the increasing reports of pockets of unsold homes and rising vacancy rates in apartment buildings may also signal in part that the lush days of big backlog demand for housing are reaching an end
 in a way we may be witnessing the same thing in the sales of automobiles today as the public no longer is willing to purchase any car coming on the market but is more insistent on compact cars free of the frills which were accepted in the fifties
 the huge backlog of demand which was evident in the first decade and a half after the war was fed by liquid assets accumulated by the public during the war and even more so by the easier and easier credit in the consumer loan and home loan fields
 the consuming public has used up a good part of these liquid assets or they have been drained by the rising price level and we have apparently gotten to the end of the line in making consumer or home mortgage terms easier
 this is not to say that the level of consumer expenditures will not continue to rise in the sixties
 i am confident that it will but consumer spending in the sixties will not be fortified by the great backlog of wants and desires which characterized most of the fifties
 markets should become more competitive as consumers become more selective
 accordingly during the sixties our national economy is likely to grow at as fast a rate as in the fifties and in the process to require enormous amounts of capital funds
 wage-price policies of industry are the result of a complex of forces- no single explanation has been found which applies to all cases
 the purpose of this paper is to analyze one possible force which has not been treated in the literature but which we believe makes a significant contribution to explaining the wage-price behavior of a few very important industries
 while there may be several such industries to which the model of this paper is applicable the authors make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wages and prices in the steel industry of the united states since world war 2 8
 indeed the apparent stiffening of the industry's attitude in the recent steel strike has a direct explanation in terms of the model here presented
 the model of this paper considers an industry which is not characterized by vigorous price competition but which is so basic that its wage-price policies are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny
 where the industry's product price has been kept below the profit-maximizing and entry-limiting prices due to fears of public reaction the profit seeking producers have an interest in offering little real resistance to wage demands
 the contribution of this paper is a demonstration of this proposition and an exploration of some of its implications 9
 in order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force which we may call the effect of public-limit pricing on key wage bargains we deliberately simplify the model by abstracting from other forces such as union power which may be relevant in an actual situation
 for expository purposes this is best treated as a model which spells out the conditions under which an important industry affected with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wages even in the absence of union pressures for higher wages
 part 1 below describes this abstract model by spelling out its assumptions
 part 2 discusses the operation of the model and derives some significant conclusions
 part 3 discusses the empirical relevance and policy implications of the conclusions
 part 4 is a brief summary
 the mathematical appendix presents the rigorous argument but is best read after part 1 in order that the assumptions underlying the equations may be explicit
 the industry with which this model is concerned is a basic industry producing a substantial share of gross national product 7
 for the purposes of setting the product price the industry behaves as a single entity
 the demand we are concerned with aggregate demand for the industry's product
 the manner in which this is shared among firms is taken as given 8
 in any given time period the aggregate demand for the industry's product is determined by two things: the price charged by the industry and the level of gnp
 for the purposes of this discussion the problem of relative prices is encompassed in these two variables since gnp includes other prices 5
 the form of the industry demand function is one which makes quantity demanded vary inversely with the product price and vary directly with the level of gnp
 the industry of this model is so important that its wage and price policies are affected with a public interest
 because of its importance and because the lack of price competition is well recognized the industry is under considerable public pressure not to raise its price any more than could be justified by cost increases
 the threat of effective anti-trust action provoked by gouging the public through price increases not justified by cost increases and fears of endangering relations with customers congress the general public and the press all operate to keep price increases in some relation to cost increases
 for the industry of this model the effect of such public pressures in the past has been to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing price and even below the entry-limited price 7
 for such an industry it is only safe to raise its price if such an increase is manifestly justified by rising costs  5
 thus if public pressure sets the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge this pressure is itself a function of the wage rate
 in this model we abstract from all non-wage sources of cost changes so that the public-limit price only rises as the wage rate rises
 in such circumstances it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate 11
 since marginal costs rise when the wage rate rises the profit-maximizing price also rises when the public-limit price is elevated and is likely to remain well above the latter
 the entry-limiting price will also be raised for potential domestic competition but unless general inflation permits profit margins to increase proportionately throughout the economy we might expect the public-limit price to approach the entry-limit price 6
 the foreign-entry-limit price would be approached more rapidly since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign costs directly 6
 where this approach becomes critical the industry can be expected to put much emphasis on this as evidence of its sincerity in resisting the wage pressures of a powerful union requesting tariff relief after it has reluctantly acceded to the union pressure
 whether or not it is in the industry's interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depends upon the extent to which the public-limit price rises in response to a basic wage increase and the relation of this response to the increase in costs accompanying the wage increase
 the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is itself a function of three things: the passage of time the level of gnp and the size of the wage increase
 we are abstracting from the fact of strikes here but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price is raised by a given increase in the basic wage rate is also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry
 the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure on the union but in order to educate the government and the customers of the industry
 as a strike continues these parties increase their pressure on the industry to reach an agreement
 they become increasingly willing to accept the price increase that the industry claims the wage bargain would entail
 public indignation and resistance to wage-price increases is obviously much less when the increases are on the order of 3% per annum than when the increases are on the order of 3% per month 5
 the simple passage of an additional eleven months' time makes the second 3% boost more acceptable
 thus the public-limit price is raised further by a given wage increase the longer it has been since the previous price increase 5
 notice however that the passage of time does not permit the raising of prices per se without an accompanying wage increase 7
 similarly higher levels of gnp do not in themselves provide grounds for raising prices but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise prices higher for a given wage increase 6
 this is not extended to anticipated levels of gnp however- only the current level of gnp affects the public pressure against wage-price increases
 finally since the public requires some restraint on the part of the companies larger wage increases call for less than proportionately larger price increases a price increase of 7% a wage increase of 10% allows a price 
 we assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation is constant with respect to quantity produced  and is the same for every firm
 the level of this average cost is determined by factor prices technology and so forth
 as we have noted however we are abstracting from changes in all determinants of this level except for changes in the wage rate 9
 the level of average cost is e
 union policies and collective the single union which faces the industry does not restrict its membership and there is an adequate supply of labor available to the firms of the industry at the going wage rate
 the union does not regard unemployment of its own members as a matter of concern when setting its own wage policy- its concern with employment makes itself felt in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment
 the union vigorously demands wage increases from productivity increases and wage increases to offset cost- of-living increases but we abstract from these forces here
 for our present purposes we assume that the sole subject of bargaining is the basic wage rate and it is this basic wage rate which determines the level of costs
 productivity is something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a given time period is not even well known to the industry much less to the union or to the public 6
 disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbates the problem of agreeing how an increase in profit margins related to a productivity increase should be shared
 the existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wages does not contradict the assumption that the union is willing to settle for cost- of-living and productivity-share increases as distinct from a cost-raising increase in the basic wage rate
 we assume further that the union recognizes the possibility that price-level increases may offset wage-rate increases and it does not entirely disregard the effect of price increases arising from its own wage increases upon the real wage rate
 for internal political reasons the union asks for increases in the basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards is essentially up to the discretion of the companies of the industry
 changes in the basic wage rate are cost-raising and they constitute an argument for raising prices
 however it is not known to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase is caused by a given change in the basic wage rate although the companies are presumed to have reliable estimates of this magnitude
 in this model then the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may in circumstances to be spelled out in part 2 below find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise
 thus for non-negative changes in the basic wage rate the industry becomes the active wage-setter since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence 6
 the presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case on the grounds that it is clearly not in the interest of the industry to raise wages gratuitously 6
 from this presumption it is an easy step to the conclusion that any observed increases in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assumed in our model 7
 it is this conclusion that we challenge; we do so by disproving the presumption on which it is based
 of the model it is convenient to assume that the union-industry contract is of one year's duration
 in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations became international law
 several factors contributed to this change
 the congress of vienna is a convenient starting point because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow
 here in 1815 the great nations assembled to legislate not merely for europe but for the world
 thus the congress marks a formal recognition of the political system that was central to world politics for a century
 international law had to fit the conditions of europe and nothing that could not fit this system or the interests of the great european nations collectively could possibly emerge as law in any meaningful sense
 essentially this imposed two conditions: first international law had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of states were competitive suspicious and opportunistic in their political alignments with one another; second it had to be compatible with the value system that they shared 4
 in both respects international law was europeanized 16
 it was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two conditions
 on the one hand the major european nations had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal equality- thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the flexibility of alignment that the system required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition of the disastrous napoleonic experience
 but there was no pressing need to maintain these same standards with regard to most of the rest of the world
 thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nations and the smaller european states did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies elsewhere
 political interference in africa and asia and even in latin america by the special interest of the united states as expressed in the monroe doctrine itself from the outset related to european politics was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values and the european balance itself
 a nation such as switzerland could be neutralized by agreement and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality; more doubtful but possible was the neutralization of the latin american countrie s; out of the question was the neutralization of asia and africa 6
 this europeanization of the law was made explicit by a number of 19th century scholars
 more emphasis was put upon the fact that international law was the law of civilized nations; kent and story the great early american scholars repeatedly made use of this phrase or of christian nations which is a substantial equivalent
 wheaton stated that the public law was essentially limited to the civilized and christian peoples of europe or to those of european origin
 of course it had always been of european origin in fact but it had maintained a universal outlook under the natural law theory 9
 now with virtually every writer not only was the european origin of public law acknowledged as a historical phenomenon but the rules thus established by the advanced civilizations of europe were to be imposed on others
 the european customs on which international law was based were to become by force and fiat the customs that others were to accept as law if they were to join this community as sovereign states 6
 hall for example was quite explicit on this point when he said states outside european civilization must formally enter into the circle of law-governed countries
 they must do something with the acquiescence of the latter or some of them which amounts to an acceptance of the law in its entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction
 during the nineteenth century these views were protested by virtually all the latin american writers though ineffectively just as the new nations of africa and asia protest them with more effect today
 a number of other nineteenth-century developments contributed to the transmutation of the law of nations into international law; that is from aspects of a universal system of justice into particular rules governing the relations of sovereign states
 the difference is important for although the older law of nations did cover relationships among sovereigns this was by no means its exclusive domain
 the law of nature governed sovereigns in their relationship to their own citizens to foreigners and to each other in a conceptually unified system
 the theory of international law which in the nineteenth century became common to virtually all writers in europe and america broke this unity and this universality
 it lost sight of the individual almost entirely and confined itself to rules limiting the exercise of state power for reasons essentially unconnected with justice or morality save as these values might affect international relations
 no longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations to determine what he ought to do; his search was merely for rules that might limit his freedom of action
 to appreciate this development we must relate it to other aspects of nineteenth-century philosophy
 first and most obvious was the growing nationalism and the tendency to regard the state and the individual's identification with the state as transcending other ties of social solidarity
 national identification was not new but it was accelerating in intensity and scope throughout europe as new unifications occurred 7
 it reached its ultimate philosophical statement in notions of state will put forward by the germans especially by hegel although political philosophers will recognize its origins in the rejected doctrines of hobbes
 national identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law theories which incorporated this hegelian abstraction and saw law domestic and international simply as its formal reflection 6
 in the international community this reduced law to jellinek's auto-limitation
 a state the highest form of human organization in fact and theory could be subjected to law only by a manifestation of self-will or consent
 according to the new theories the nineteenth century corporate sovereign was sovereign in a quite new and different sense from his historical predecessors
 he no longer sought to find the law; he made it; he could be subjected to law only because he agreed to be
 there was no law domestic or international except that willed by acknowledged by or consented to by states
 hidden behind hegelian abstractions were more practical reasons for a changing jurisprudence
 related to but distinguishable from nationalism was the growth of democracy in one form or another
 increased participation in politics and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions
 the efforts of various interest groups to control or influence governmental decisions particularly when taken in conjunction with the impact of industralization led to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the means whereby policy could be formulated and enforced as law through bureaucratic institutions
 law became a conscious process something more than simply doing justice and looking to local customs and a common morality for applicable norms
 particularly was this true when the norms previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many when customs were rapidly changing as the forces of the new productivity were harnessed
 the old way of doing things which depended on a relatively stable community with stable ideas dealing with familiar situations was no longer adequate to the task
 first was the period of codification of existing law: the code napoleon in france and the peculiar codification that in fact resulted from austin's restatement and ordering of the common law in england 5
 codification was followed in all countries by a growing amount of legislation some changing and adjusting the older law much dealing with entirely new situations
 the legislative mills have been grinding ever since and when its cumbersome processes were no longer adequate to the task a limited legislative authority was delegated in one form or another to the executive
 whereas the eighteenth century had been a time in which man sought justice the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries in which men are satisfied with law
 indeed with developed positivism the separation of law from justice or from morality generally became quite specific 5
 in municipal systems we tend to view what is called positivism as fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increasing the power of parliame nt- the elected representatives- at the expense of the more conservative judiciary
 when the power of the latter was made both limited and explicit- when norms were clarified and made more precise and the creation of new norms was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands- two purposes were served: government was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will and law became a rational system for implementing that will for serving conscious goals for embodying the public policy 5
 it is true that initially the task was to remove restrictions that it was thought inhibited the free flow of money goods and labor; but even laissez-faire was a conscious policy
 law was seen as an emanation of the sovereign will
 however the sovereign was not hobbes' absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of austin
 it was too an optimistic philosophy and though it separated law from morality it was by no means an immoral or amoral one 7
 man through democratic institutions of government and economic freedom was master of his destiny
 the theory did not require though it unfortunately might acquire a hegelian mystique
 it was merely a rationalization and ordering of new institutions of popular government
 it was not opposed to either justice or morality; it merely wished to minimize subjective views of officials who wielded public authority
 particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism became the dominant credo of western society
 to free the factors of production was a major objective of the rising bourgeoisie and this objective required that governmental authority- administrative officials and judges- be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible; that old customs which inhibited trade be abrogated; that business be free from governmental supervision and notions of morality which might clog the automatic adjustments of the free market; that obligations of status that were inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be done away with 4
 contract- conceived as the free bargain of formal equals- replaced the implied obligations of a more static and status-conscious society 7
 indeed contract was the dominant legal theme of the century the touchstone of the free society
 government itself was based upon contract; business organization- the corporation- was analyzed in contractual terms; trade was based on freedom of contract and money was lent and borrowed on contractual terms; even marriage and the family was seen as a contractual arrangement
 it is not surprising that the international obligations of states were also viewed in terms of contract
 in fact some- anzilotti is the principle example- went so far as to say that all international law could be traced to the single legal norm pacta sunt servanda
 the displacement of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by positivism reshaped both international law theory and doctrine
 in the first place the new doctrine brought a formal separation of international from municipal law rejecting the earlier view that both were parts of a universal legal system
 one result was to nationalize much that had been regarded as the law of nations
 admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problems which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country were all severed from the older law of nations and made dependent on the several national laws
 private international law was thus segregated from international law proper or as it is often called public international law 6
 states were free to enact within broad though determinate limits their own rules as to the application of foreign law by their courts to vary the law merchant and to enact legislation with regard to many claims arising on the high seas
 the change was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms continued to be invoked by municipal courts and were only gradually changed by legislation and then largely in marginal situations
 mr justice black was one of the minority that rested on the article 1 power
 in this view supported by only three members of the court a power denied by the specific provisions of article 3 was granted by the generality of article 1
 if this seems arbitrary its effect was to treat citizens of the district of columbia equally with citizens of the states- at the expense of expanding a troublesome jurisdiction
 for almost a hundred years we relied upon state courts for the protection of most rights arising under national law
 then in 1875 apparently in response to the nationalizing influence of the civil war congress first gave the lower federal courts general authority- concurrently with state tribunals- to decide cases involving federal-right questions
 one purpose of the change was to attain sympathetic enforcement of rights insured by the civil war amendments against state interference
 serious difficulty arose with the advent of substantive due process
 an amendment presumably designed to deal with the problems of newly freed slaves became a laissez-faire limitation upon state economic policy
 a flood of federal lower court injunctions seriously impeded the processes of local government
 congress reacted with a series of measures modifying in various ways what it had granted in 1875
 in 1910 it required the convening of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain injunctions and allowed direct appeals to the supreme court
 such legislation was clarified and extended from time to time thereafter
 in 1913 an abortive provision was made for the stay of federal injunction proceedings upon institution of state court test cases 8
 the essential ineffectiveness of these measures resulted in 1934 in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate orders
 three years later similar restraints were imposed upon injunctions against collection of state taxes
 this saved for state adjudication in the first instance the two major areas where federal injunctions had been most obnoxious but other areas remained vulnerable
 meanwhile the supreme court like congress showed misgivings concerning this aspect of government by injunction 9
 drawing upon the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr justice holmes introduced a series of self-imposed judicial restraints that culminated in mr justice frankfurter's famous doctrine of abstention
 whereas the earlier cases turned rather narrowly upon the availability of adequate state remedies the new emphasis is upon the nature of the state policy at issue
 the classic case is railroad commission v pullman
 the commission had issued an administrative order which was challenged as discriminatory against negroes
 its enforcement was enjoined by a federal trial court 7
 on review the supreme court via mr justice frankfurter found southern racial problems a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal courts ought not to enter unless no alternative to h adjudication is open
 an alternative was found in the vagueness of state law as to whether the offending order had in fact been authorized
 reluctant as usual to interpret state legislation- such interpretation can only be a forecast rather than a determination- mr justice frankfurter led a unanimous court to vacate the injunction 6
 but it is crucial that here unlike burford the trial court was ordered to retain the case until the state courts had had a reasonable opportunity to settle the state-law question
 the resources of equity are equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision as well as the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication
 temporary abstention ie postponement is one thing; refusal to adjudicate is another
 to the extent that the jurisdictional principle of 1875 stands unmodified by subsequent legislation federal equitable relief against state action must be available- or so it seems to mr justice frankfurter
 in alabama public service commission v southern ry co the commission had refused to permit abandonment of certain uneconomic train facilities
 the railroad claiming deprivation of property without due process of law sought injunctive relief
 the court held that federal jurisdiction should not be exercised lest the domestic policy of the state be obstructed; this in the name of equitable discretion
 justices frankfurter and jackson concurred in the court's result for they found no merit in the railroad's claim
 but they objected vigorously to the proposition that federal courts may refuse to exercise jurisdiction conferred in a valid act of congress:   by one fell swoop the court now finds that congress indulged in needless legislation in the acts of 1910 1913 1925 1934 and 1937 4
 by these measures congress so the court in effect now decides gave not only needless but inadequate relief since it now appears that the federal courts have inherent power to sterilize the act of 1875 against all proceedings challenging local regulation 5
 a most revealing recent case is textile workers union v lincoln mills
 the taft-hartley act gave the federal courts jurisdiction over suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce 6
 on its face this merely provides a federal forum; it does not establish any law for the federal judges to enforce
 how can judges exercise jurisdiction to enforce national rights when congress has created none? 7
  the court held that congress had intended the federal judiciary to fashion an appropriate law of labor-management contracts 7
 in short congressional power to grant federal-question authority to federal courts is now apparently so broad that congress need not create or specify the right to be enforced
 the lincoln mills decision authorizes a whole new body of federal common law which as mr justice frankfurter pointed out in dissent leads to one of the following incongruities: conflict in federal and state court interpretations of collective bargaining agreements; displacement of state law by federal law in state courts h in all actions regarding collective bargaining agreements; or exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matters
 the justice's elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggests that congress' purpose was merely to make unions suable
 with a few exceptions the lawmakers seemed unaware of the technical problems of federal jurisdiction involved- to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judges
 to avoid these constitutional difficulties mr justice frankfurter was prepared to read the taft-hartley provision as concerned with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction
 this would satisfy what presumably was congress' major purpose- the suability of unions
 it would also leave intact the states' traditional authority in the realm of contract law
 and york decisions require federal courts in diversity cases here again mr justice frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial legislation
 if congress wants to displace the states from areas which they have customarily occupied let it do so knowingly and explicitly 7
 and let it do its own lawmaking and not leave that to federal judges
 does lincoln mills suggest that if congress granted jurisdiction over interstate divorce cases the federal courts would be authorized to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriages? 7
  there is a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity cases
 congress has not clearly defined the bounds between state and federal court competence
 it has the power to do so but for the most part has left the matter for solution by judges on a case- by-case basis
 a careful student has suggested that in any new revision of the judicial code the legislators would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal courts should be limited to those matters in which their expertise in federal law might be used leaving to the state judiciaries the primary obligation of pronouncing state law
 obviously the goal here proposed is the guiding principle in mr justice frankfurter's opinions- to the extent that congress leaves the problem to judicial discretion
 the same rule of specialization and division of labor guides him in the fela certiorari cases in the administrative law area and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review
 mr justice bla ck no doubt concurs in principle but is more apt to make exceptions to achieve a generous and just result 5
 he will not be fooled by technicalities
 with few exceptions congress has not given federal courts exclusive authority to enforce rights arising under federal law 6
 to put it differently state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claims of federal right 9
 to insure uniformity in the meaning of national law however state interpretations are subject to supreme court review 6
 it may be noted parenthetically that to evade desegregation an ex-justice and former southern governor has urged congress to abolish this reviewing authority
 the result of course would be that federal law inevitably would mean different things in different states
 it would also probably mean different things within the same state- depending upon what court rendered decision
 we consider here only a few of many problems involved in this crucial federal-state relationship
 the first is that enforcement of national law in state litigation raises in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance
 subject to certain constitutional restraints in favor of fair trials each level of government is free to devise its own judicial procedures
 litigants who choose to assert federal claims in a state court go into that court subject to its rules of procedure
 a similar canon applies to those who press state claims in federal tribunals eg in diversity cases
 in an fela controversy the state court followed established state procedure by construing a vague complaint most strongly against the complainant
 in other words the burden of pleading clearly rested upon the pleader by state la w
 the result was that the plaintiff's case was dismissed 17
 mr justice black led a reversing majority: strict local rules of pleading cannot be used to impose unnecessary burdens upon rights of recovery authorized by federal law
 here as in the byrd case another element of state procedure was subsumed to federal judge-made law
 justices frankfurter and jackson dissented: one state may cherish formalities more than another one state may be more responsive than another to procedural reforms
 if a litigant chooses to enforce a federal right in a state court he cannot be heard to object if he is treated exactly as are plaintiffs who press like claims arising under state law with regard to the form in which the claim must be stated- the particularity for instance with which a cause of action must be described 6
 federal law though invoked in a state court delimits the federal claim- defines what gives a right to recovery and what goes to prove it
 but the form in which the claim must be stated need not be different from what the state exacts in the enforcement of like obligations created by it so long as a requirement does not add to or diminish the right as defined by federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the actualities of litigation 6
 another problem in the area of federal-state relationships is this: what constitutes reversible error in a state decision? 7
  terminiello v chicago involved a conviction for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance
 the conduct in question was a speech
 the accused did not object to the trial court's charge to the jury that discourse may constitute a breach of the peace if it stirs the public to anger invites dispute brings about a condition of unrest h
 for present purposes it may be assumed that this charge so narrowly limited speech as to violate the federal constitution 6
 though the accused raised many other objections he did not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceedings
 that is he did not claim in any of the four courts through which his case progressed that the jury charge had denied him any federal right
 how else can one explain for example allowing the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium but not the right to amortize bond issue expenses; or allowing a deduction for payment of certain obligations of a transferor assumed in the reorganization but not a deduction for theft losses sustained by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discovered after it; or requiring a transferor to carry over its method of depeciation but not allowing rapid amortization of emergency facilities transferred in a reorganization; or allowing survival of a dividend carryover to a personal holding company 381 but not carryover of excess tax credits for foreign taxes? 5
  these items and most of the others listed above seem quite comparable to items whose right of survival is provided for in section 381
 there does not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in terms of the nature of the tax attribute or in terms of tax-avoidance possibilities
 with respect to items such as these the provisions of section 381 viewed in historical perspective suggest a rule requiring survival whether the items are beneficial or detrimental to the surviving corporation
 to this extent some stretching of the literal meaning of the committee report seems justified since the literal meaning conflicts with the clear implication if not the language of the statute 7
 it is not contended that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor's tax attributes
 such an interpretation could not be justified by a construction of the statute alone; it would certainly violate the intention of congress as expressed in the committee report; and in at least one instance involving refund claims it might be contrary to another provision of the united states code
 section 203 of the united states code voids an assignment of a claim against the government unless made after it has been allowed the amount due has been ascertained and a warrant for its payment has been issued
 if it were not for judicial development of certain exceptions this section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquiring corporation for taxes paid by a transferor corporation even though the reorganization meets the requirements of section 381
 a clearly recognized exception is a statutory merger or consolidation
 the leading case seaboard air line railway v united states held that the transferee could sue for a refund of taxes paid by the transferor and it has been consistently followed
 the court said the purpose of the section was principally to spare the government the embarrassment and trouble of dealing with several parties one of them a stranger to the claim and to prevent traffic in claims particularly tenuous claims against the government 5
 neither reason said the court applied to the case at hand; furthermore congress could not be presumed to have intended to obstruct mergers approved by the states
 other exceptions are assignments for the benefit of creditors corporate dissolutions transfers by descent or transfers by subrogation 6
 exceptions are often classified as transfers by operation of law 8
 a tax-free reorganization not complying with the merger or consolidation statutes of the states involved is difficult to fit into an operation of law mold
 although it is in some ways comparable to a voluntary sale of assets for cash to which section 203 quite clearly applies the courts and treasury have held that acquiring corporations in several types of non-taxable reorganizations may sue for refund of taxes paid by transferors
 a recent case in point is mitchell canneries v united states in which a claim against the government was transferred first from a corporation to a partnership whose partners were former stockholders and then to another corporation formed by the partners
 holding the final corporation entitled to sue on the claim the court cited the seaboard novo trading and roomberg cases for the proposition that h transfers by operation of law or in conjunction with changes of corporate structure are n ot assignments prohibited by the statute
 in an earlier case kingan + co v united states an american corporation was formed for the purpose of acquiring the stock of a british corporation in exchange for its own stock and then liquidating the british corporation
 the anti-assignment statute was held not to prevent the american corporation from suing for a refund of taxes paid by the british corporation
 the transaction presumably would have qualified under section 368 as a contractual reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation but not under section 368 as a statutory merger of consolidation 5
 the court nevertheless relied on the seaboard case and also mentioned that the shareholders of the two corporations were the same 7
 in substance said the court there was no transfer of equitable title
 the treasury arrives at substantially the same conclusion but skirts the problem of section 203 of the united states code 12
 revenue ruling 54-17 provides that if the corporation against which a tax was assessed has since been liquidated by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund should be filed by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which paid the tax followed by the name of the successor corporation 5
 proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be filed
 if the succession is a matter of public record certificates of the secretaries of state or other public officials having custody of the documents will suffice; if the succession is not of record all documents relating to such succession properly certified are required 5
 the former proof seems applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition
 the ruling would not however apply to an acquisition of assets for cash
 a recent ruling although rather confusing cites and follows rev rul 54-17
 the ruling suggests also that it applies to either a statutory or contractual reorganization
 hence a successor corporation in a c reorganization appears entitled to sue for a refund of taxes paid by the merged corporation despite section 203
 in a b reorganization followed by a section 332 liquidation those cases which hold that section 203 is inapplicable to transfers in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of taxes paid by the transferor
 in fact a cash purchase of a corporation's stock followed by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the kimbell-diamond doctrine is not applied to eliminate the intermediate step
 as stated in seaboard and numerous other cases the two primary reasons for the enactment of section 203 of the united states code were to prevent the government from having to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claims on a contingent-fee basis
 the cases have allowed transfer of claims if beneficial ownership is not changed
 the first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meets the conditions of section 381 which is the only type presently under discussion
 section 381 applies only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary owned to the extent of at least 80 per cent a statutory merger or consolidation an acquisition of substantially all a corporation's assets solely in exchange for voting stock or a change of identity form or place of organization
 in virtually every case the transferor corporation is liquidated and its former stockholders either own outright or have a continuing stock interest in the assets which gave rise to the tax
 in these circumstances the possibility of multiple or conflicting claims is exceedingly remote
 furthermore in a c reorganization the continuing interest of stockholders of the corporation which paid the tax must be greater than is necessary in a statutory merger to which the statute is clearly inapplicable
 nor is it at all likely that a desperate claim against the government will be assigned on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization
 if the transferor has substantial assets other than the claim it seems reasonable to assume no corporation would be willing to acquire all of its properties in the dim hope of collecting a claim for refund of taxes
 if such an unlikely transaction were to take place it would more logically be accomplished by a stock purchase followed by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary followed by liquidation
 in the rare case where a corporation's only substantial asset or its most important one is a claim for refund perhaps its transfer should not be permitted whether the reorganization takes the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of assets for stock 6
 it appears then that although the matter is not dealt with in section 381 a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specified in section 381 is entitled to sue for refund of taxes paid by a transferor corporation
 section 203 of the united states code has been interpreted as not applying to claims against the government transferred in tax-free reorganizations
 the successor corporations have been held entitled to sue on such claims
 tax attributes of the transferor there are certain tax attributes of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the facts of the particular reorganization involved
 for example property used in the trade or business of a transferor corporation as defined in section 1231 presumably would not retain its special status following a non-taxable reorganization if it is not so used in the business of the acquiring corporation 8
 the parent of a group filing consolidated returns might be treated as the same corporation following a reorganization defined in section 368 but as a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which had not for example elected to file consolidated returns with its own subsidiaries 4
 similar considerations presumably made it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquired and acquiring corporations have different methods of accounting or depreciation
 other sections of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of a transferor's tax attributes following a tax-free reorganization
 section 362 requires carryover of the transferor corporation's basis for property transferred and section 1223 provides for tacking on the transferor's holding period for such property to that of the transferee
 section 169 permits a person acquiring grain-storage facilities to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period 5
 however a similar privilege was not specifically provided in section 168 for attributes similar to a loss there may be certain items which are quite similar to a net operating loss carryover or operating deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the conditions applicable to those items 5
 for example suppose another excess profits tax similar to prior laws is enacted providing for carryover of excess profits credits 6
 this carryover right has a number of things in common with a net operating loss carryover
 it is an averaging device intended to ease the tax burden of fluctuating income; it is a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expects to have a high excess profits tax
 under the 1939 code this item was permitted to survive a tax-free reorganization in the stanton brewery case but only over the dissent of judge learned hand who wrote the majority opinion in the sansome case a leading case requiring carryover of earnings and profits in a non-taxable reorganization
 since this type of item was not in the statute when section 381 was enacted in 1954 one cannot say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have
 with respect to this type of item one might properly apply the language of the committee report quoted above which cautions against using section 381 as a basis for treating other tax attributes not mentioned therein
 actually there do not presently appear to be items in the statute comparable to a net operating loss carryover
 probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operating loss carryover is the unique opportunity it presents for tax avoidance
 there were two methods that could have been used for conducting the study within the resources available: interviews in depth with a few selected companies and the more limited interrogation of a large number of companies by means of a mail questionnaire
 while the method of interviewing a small number of companies was appealing because of the opportunity it might have furnished to probe fully the reasons and circumstances of a company's practices and opinions it also involved the risk of paying undue attention to the unique and peculiar problems of just a few individual companies 6
 as a result it was decided that a mail questionnaire sent to a large number of companies would be more effective in determining the general practices and opinions of small firms and in highlighting some of the fundamental and recurring problems of defense procurement that concern both industry and government
 it was also hoped that responses to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiries that might be made in subsequent studies of a more detailed nature
 it is recognized that a mail questionnaire has inherent limitations
 there is the danger that the questions will mean different things to different respondents
 simple yes or no answers do not reveal the different shades of opinion that the various respondents may have
 a respondent may want to make alternative answers because he does not know the precise circumstances assumed in the question 10
 there is also the problem of the respondent's frame of reference 17
 is the respondent making a recommendation for his own benefit for the benefit of his industry for the benefit of a specific government department or service for the benefit of the defense program for the benefit of small business or for the benefit of the taxpayers? 10
    there is also the question of whether the respondent based his answers on factual information and carefully considered judgment or whether his answers were casual guesses
 finally there is the question of how strongly an expressed opinion is held- whether it is a firm opinion or one that the respondent favors only slightly over the alternatives
 the research team was very mindful of these dangers and limitations of a mail questionnaire
 under the circumstances however the team considered it would provide the most useful information at this point
 in the preparation of the questionnaire the problems noted above were carefully considered and the structure and phraseology used were designed to minimize the effects of these limitations 6
 the questionnaire was designed to elicit three types of information: the facts regarding certain characteristics of the respondents including their experience with and interest in securing defense business; the actual selling and buying practices of the respondents; and the attitudes and opinions of the respondents concerning bidding procedures and the methods of awarding defense contracts
 it was hoped that the facts concerning the characteristics and practices of the respondents would offer clues to the reasons why they took the positions and made the recommendations which they did 6
 the major sections of the questionnaire are devoted to the following: information for classifying respondents characteristics of defense sales activities respondents' practices in participating in advertised bidding for defense business respondents' practices in participating in negotiated bidding for defense purposes respondents' opinions regarding advertised bidding respondents' opinions regarding negotiated bidding respondents' preferences regarding the methods of awarding defense contracts   the questionnaire provided a place for the name of the respondent but stated that identification of the respondent was optional
 the questionnaire also stated that in any event all replies would be treated confidentially
 it is interesting to note that 75 per cent of those who returned the questionnaire identified themselves
 the questionnaire the research team prepared and then revised the questionnaire over a period of six months
 in june 1960 an early draft of the questionnaire along with a cover letter was mailed to fourteen companies in the state of washington 9
 several days after the companies had received the questionnaire members of the research team contacted the presidents of eleven of these companies in person or by phone to discuss any ambiguities or difficulties the addressees might have experienced in completing the questionnaire
 this test resulted in further revisions of the questionnaire 11
 the research team was concerned that responses from firms in the state of washington might not be typical of those throughout the country or that the results might be different when no phone or personal follow-up was made
 accordingly another test of the questionaire was made 9
 the revised draft was mailed in july 1960 to 100 firms throughout the united states
 fifty of the 100 firms were selected on a random basis from 3500 names submitted by member companies of the aerospace industries association and fifty were selected in a similar manner from a list of 1500 names compiled by the research team from the thomas register 6
 the method of compiling the aia and tr lists will be described later
 ten days after the questionnaires were mailed follow-up airmail postcards were sent urging those companies which had not yet returned their questionnaires to do so at once
 twenty-eight returns in all were received
 the responses were carefully checked for obvious errors in the answers or for questions that were apparently not understood by the respondent
 the cover letter questionnaire and follow-up postcard were then revised into final form of mailing lists the objective of the study was to determine the opinions and practices of small firms selling to defense programs
 the firms to receive the questionnaires were selected with this objective in mind
 three lists of companies were made and used in the study 6
 the first was a list of fourteen manufacturing companies located in the state of washington which were personally known to the research team to be active in defense work
 the primary consideration in the compilation of this list was convenience in discussing the questionnaire with company officers 6
 the second list was derived from a group of approximately 8000 names supplied to the research team by the aerospace industries association
 these names were secured from member companies by the association from the forty-four sources listed in appendix f 6
 each source selected from its approved bidders list about 200 firms which it believed to be small businesses that participated in the production of weapons and weapon support systems
 where possible the name of an executive was supplied along with the company name and address
 the forty-four lists supplied by the aia member companies were merged and duplicate names were eliminated
 there was further elimination of all companies that were not accompanied by the name of a responsible company executive 10
 the remaining names were then checked against the thomas register list and duplicate names were removed from the aia lists 7
 by these steps the final aia list was reduced from 8000 to 3500 6
 the third list was selected by the research team on a random basis from the thomas register
 it was compiled as a control sample to determine if the opinions and practices of companies on the lists submitted by the members of the aerospace industries association were materially different from those of other small firms selling to defense programs
 such a difference might have resulted from: the fact that the aerospace industries association members whose lists were used did not comprise all firms engaged in defense programs
 the fact that companies on the aia lists were already participating in the defense program because of the manner of their selection
 accordingly as in-group they might have differe nt opinions and practices than an out-group composed of those companies not so participating but interested in defense business
 the fact that aia lists might not have been selected on a random basis
 the control sample was selected by taking the bottom name of each of the two columns of names on each page of the alphabetical listing of manufacturers in the thomas register
 if the bottom name in each column did not have a responsible executive identified the next name above which identified such a responsible executive was substituted
 fifteen hundred names were selected in this fashion 9
 mailing the questionnaire each questionnaire was mailed with a cover letter addressed personally to the president or other executive of each firm
 the questionnaires were mailed in seattle washington and sent by regular mail to addresses in the states of idaho montana oregon and washington
 airmail was used for the addresses outside the pacific northwest 8
 each letter contained a postage-prepaid return envelope by regular mail for addresses in the pacific northwest and by airmail for those outside the pacific northwest
 approximately ten days after the questionnaire was mailed a follow- up airmail postcard was sent to each of the original names 6
 the first test mailing was made in june 1960
 the second test mailing was made in july 1960 10
 the final mailing of the questionnaire was made late in august 1960 to 4900 firms consisting of 3450 from the aia list and 1450 from the tr list
 returns received over 1000 returns were received within two weeks after the final mailing was made
 they continued to arrive until the end of december 1960 by which time a total of 1343 returns were received representing 26 8
 8 per cent of the 5014 questionnaires sent out
 fifty-seven returns could not be used because they were incomplete or received too late to be processed
 the remaining 1286 returns that were processed came from the categories in table 2
 each questionnaire was audited for obvious mistakes and for comments and was identified by a serial number by the source list from which the company name was selected and by the geographical location of the company as determined by the postmark on the return envelope 6
 all responses except comments were numerically coded to permit use of data-processing equipment
 the codes were key-punched into ibm punch cards and verified 10
 each return required three cards and involved key punching 228 digital columns
 in order to be able to properly relate the data for a single company each of the three cards comprising the set for each firm was identified with the appropriate serial number of the respondent 9
 the cards were then processed using standard ibm punch card equipment including an ibm 650 computer
 the first step in processing was to analyze the returns from questions 1 2 and 3 to determine whether the respondents were large businesses or small businesses in accordance with the definitions contained in aspr section 1-701
 the results are shown in table 3
 the returns from companies classified as large businesses were set aside and not used because they were not relevant to a study of the opinions and practices of small firms
 the second step in processing was to compare the responses from companies on the aia list with those from companies on the tr list in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to merge the responses for the purposes of the study
 the methods and results of this comparative analysis are described in appendix h
 it was concluded that it would be appropriate to process the two groups of responses as a single sample of all small businesses engaged in or wishing to sell to defense program s
 in the first place the two groups of firms when combined had characteristics and practices that were more representative of companies that were the subject of this study than did the firms from the aia list alone
 the vast central valley of california is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world
 during the summer of 1960 it became the setting for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle
 the contestants in this economic struggle are the agricultural workers organizing committee of the afl-cio and the agricultural employers of the state
 by virtue of the legal responsibilities of the department of employment in the farm placement program we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces
 it is not a pleasant or easy position but one we have endeavored to maintain
 we have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose
 inevitably one side was pleased and the other displeased regardless of how we ruled
 often the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other
 we have consoled ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding
 it is disconcerting nevertheless to read in a labor weekly perluss knuckles down to growers and then to be confronted with a growers' publication which states perluss recognizes obviously phony and trumped-up strikes as bona fide
 for a number of years there have been sporadic attempts in california to organize farm workers
 these attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons 9
 they were inadequately financed without experienced leadership and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole 6
 this past year the pattern has been different: the organizing program had the full support of the afl-cio which supplied staff and money to the awoc as well as moral support
 leadership was experienced and skillful and financial resources were significant
 regardless of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life
 as a result of these changed conditions the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relations has been much greater than in the past
 the awoc has been able to employ the traditional weapons of labor- the strike and the picket line- with considerable success particularly in the area of wages
 by the very nature of the situation it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management 8
 to date at least the strategy of the awoc has been selective; that is to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the state
 primarily we became involved in these disputes because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program 5
 normally because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility
 but the current issues arose out of the wagner-peyser act concerning referrals to an establishment where a labor dispute exists and out of public law 78 and the migrant labor agreement if mexican nationals were employed at the ranch
 most of us remember and think of the wagner-peyser act in its historical sense as a major milestone in the development of public placement services
 infrequently do we think of it as a living continuing operating control over the system
 however when labor disputes arise its provisions come clearly into play
 california has accepted the provisions of that act by enacting into our code a provision that the state of california accepts the provisions of the wagner-peyser act h and will observe and comply with the requirements of that act
 with respect to labor disputes the wagner-peyser act states only   in carrying out the provisions of this act the secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lock-outs to applicants before they are referred to employment
 other provisions of the act empower the secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions and he has done so 6
 the pertinent regulation for our purposes is section 602 10
 2 as follows:   referrals in labor dispute situations 9
 no person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute or the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute 6
 with respect to positions not covered by subparagraph of this paragraph any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral
 in analyzing this regulation let us take the last sentence first
 it permits referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute
 assume for example a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields
 the packing shed workers go on strike
 there is no dispute involving fieldwork
 we concluded that we may refer workers to the fieldwork provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute 6
 so far no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision 12
 it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue 14
 note that it prohibits referrals under either condition or condition
 employer representatives have contended that the secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition on the grounds that the wagner-peyser act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists
 the matter got into the courts this way: one of the early strikes called by the awoc was at the digiorgio pear orchards in yuba county 8
 we found that a labor dispute existed and that the workers had left their jobs which were then vacant because of the dispute 7
 accordingly under clause of the secretary's regulation we suspended referrals to the employer
 the employer seeking to continue his harvest challenged our right to cease referrals to him and sought relief in the superior court of yuba county
 the court issued a temporary restraining order directing us to resume referrals
 we of course obeyed the court order
 however the attorney general of california at the request of the secretary of labor sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the federal district court on grounds that it was predominantly a federal issue since the validity of the secretary's regulation was being challenged
 however the federal court held that since the state had accepted the provisions of the wagner-peyser act into its own code and presumably therefore also the regulations it was now a state matter 5
 it accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction whereupon the california superior court made the restraining order permanent 9
 under that order we have continued referring workers to the ranch 7
 a similar case arose at the bowers ranch in butte county and the superior court of that county issued similar restraining orders 7
 the growers have strenuously argued that i should have accepted the superior court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the secretary's regulation
 i cannot accept that view either as a lawyer or as an administrator
 first let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved
 it is an accepted juridical principle in california that a superior court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent 10
 it is conclusive unless appealed only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard
 it is not binding upon another superior court which could rule to the contrary
 only when a decision is rendered by the district court of appeal is a binding precedent established
 in that event we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrown in other superior courts
 but over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision i am convinced that the decisions of the superior courts which in effect nullify the secretary's regulation are not a correct interpretation of the secretary's power under the federal law
 i believe i am in good company in this view
 the attorney general of california concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the district court of appeal
 the attorney general of the united states in considering the power of the secretary to issue similar regulations under the wagner-peyser act relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers has rendered an opinion sustaining his authority
 further and as an evidence of legislative intent only the senate of the united states recently defeated by a substantial majority the holland amendment to the fair labor standards act which would have specifically limited the regulatory authority of the secretary in these matters
 next let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals 8
 there is far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in midair
 the ramifications of the issue are enormous
 a decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as strikebreakers
 the public interest is so dominant in such an issue that i cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two superior courts in the state
 it is an issue which may well reach the supreme court of the united states before judicial finality is achieved 14
 as an administrator i cannot place the employment service in california in jeopardy of being out of compliance with the federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of appeal open to me 7
 to have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in superior court in my opinion would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the wagner-peyser act and would have immediately opened the way for the secretary of labor were he so inclined to notify the governor of such noncompliance set a date for hearing and issue his finding
 the impact of noncompliance under the wagner-peyser act is clear: the withdrawal of some $11 million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or as a corollary the taking over by the federal government of its operation 6
 thus far the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike- condition in the regulation of the secretary
 none has yet arisen under condition relating to referral to jobs the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute
 here the problem is essentially one of defining the word filling 9
 should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job specifications union membership union jurisdiction and the like? 6
  or should it have a broader connotation of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of filling the job
 because of the uncertainty of this definition i solicited the interpretation of the secretary of labo r
 he has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the proper one; that is that if wages for example is the only issue in a labor dispute and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute we may continue to make referrals
 martin and stendler present evidence that infants and young children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combining objects and counting them 6
 after they have developed concepts they are free from the necessity of manipulating objects; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely
 the ability to think seems to increase consistently with age 10
 one experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between the eleventh and twelfth years
 many studies indicate that elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science; that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes and events; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities change and broaden
 how a child feels about himself about other people and about the tasks confronting him in school may have as much influence on his success in school as his physical and intellectual characteristics 5
 a considerable amount of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not likely to do well in school subjects 7
 emotional maturity is the result of many factors the principal ones being the experiences of the first few years of the child's life 5
 however the teacher who understands the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential in helping pupils gain confidence security and satisfaction
 concerning this responsibility of the teacher suggestions for helping children gain better control of the emotions are presented in chapter 11
 the following generalizations about the emotional characteristics of elementary-school children may be helpful
 typically the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short time as contrasted to those of an adult 6
 as the child grows older his emotional reactions lead to moods or emotional states drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly rather than in short abrupt outbursts
 studies of the growth and decline of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects noises falling and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years but that fears of the dark of being alone and of imaginary creatures or robbers increase 4
 ridiculing a child for being afraid or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing with the problem; more effective solutions include explanations the example of another child or conditioning by associating the feared object place or person with something pleasant
 children need help in learning to control their emotions 6
 the young child learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums screaming kicking and hitting will not get him what he wants; the older child learns that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers and therefore makes a real effort to control his emotions
 children differ widely in their emotional responses 7
 among infants the patterns of emotional responses are similar; as the influence of learning and environment are felt emotional behavior becomes individualized
 although no national norms exist for the social development of children the teacher can find a great deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed by children at various age levels
 the following summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school children; the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals struggling to meet their developmental needs and at the same time trying to learn the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which they hold membership 7
 during early childhood children are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than they are in the approval of other children; after they have been in school a few years their interest in playmates of their own age increases and their interest in adults decreases; the child who had once considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family gatherings now considers it a bore 6
 in late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase; the group sets the styles in clothing the kind of play engaged in and the ideals of right and wrong behavior
 in early childhood the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his own age or a year or two older who can do the things he likes to do; such factors as sex intelligence and status in the group do not influence his choice much at this time
 in later childhood an interest in team games replaces individual play; loyalty to the group a feeling of superiority over those who are not members and unwillingness to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits
 during early childhood boys tease and bully on the average more than girls; those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activities more than do well-adjusted children
 during late childhood boys like to tease jostle and talk smart to girls; girls who are more mature than boys frown upon the youthful antics of boys of their own age
 by the time pupils reach the sixth grade their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed; they exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problems but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work
 between the ages of two and four years negativism or resistance to adult authority is noticeable; after the fourth year it begins to decline
 however as we have seen in later childhood the child begins to substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers
 the elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability to work in groups
 the child in the primary grades can play harmoniously with one companion but his desire to be first in everything gets him into trouble when the group gets larger; he wants to be with people but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate
 in the middle grades however he begins to participate more effectively in group activities such as selecting a leader helping to make plans and carry on group activities and setting up rules governing the enterprise
 the teacher should study the individual pupil much progress has been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding children yet in almost any classroom today can be found children whose needs are not being met by the school program 5
 some are failing to achieve as much as their ability would permit; others never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom 9
 these children have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults who did not understand
 many school systems now employ school psychologists and child guidance specialists
 these specialists perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children who need special attention by suggesting ways of meeting the needs of individual children in the regular classroom and by providing clinical services for severely maladjusted children 5
 it is the classroom teacher however who has daily contacts with pupils and who is in a unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice
 indeed a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work of the elementary-school teacher rather than merely an additional chore
 teachers and administrators in many elementary schools have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the basi s of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals 6
 what they should recognize is that children who have been placed in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attributes that influence success and that they still must be treated as individuals
 although the teacher must be concerned with maintaining standards he must also be concerned about understanding factors that inhibit studies conducted in various sections of the united states indicate that many children in elementary schools are maladjusted emotionally and that many of them are failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects
 one study which involved 1524 pupils in grades one to six found that 12 percent of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading a year below capacity
 it is apparent therefore that the teacher needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and adjustment of children
 when a child fails to meet the standards of the school in his rate of learning insecurity unhappiness and other forms of maladjustment frequently follow
 these maladjustments in turn inhibit learning and a vicious cycle is completed
 it is easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy or that the child who lacks interest in school who dislikes the teacher or who is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent
 the causes of retardation and maladjustment may be found in physical factors such as defective speech or hearing impaired vision faulty motor coordination a frail constitution chronic disease malnutrition and glandular malfunctioning
 they may be caused by poor health habits such as faulty eating and sleeping habits
 they may be related to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain types of school work
 the curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for others
 teaching methods learning materials and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead to maladjustments for some children 6
 unwholesome family relations broken homes and undesirable community influences may also be contributing factors
 this is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit learning and contribute to maladjustment among children
 moreover these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner
 a vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading disability for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement in reading
 an impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation causing another to work harder for successful achievement in school
 at any rate the teacher who recognizes common causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement failure and maladjustment 7
 successful teaching involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment
 the classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist; he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information needed about each child in his classroom 7
 he can be expected however to examine and interpret the information already available; to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children; and to utilize opportunities arising in connection with regular classroom activities for gaining a better understanding of his pupils
 this section deals with some of the sources of information that can be tapped by the classroom teacher; chapter 15 provides more detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil progress
 most school systems today maintain a system of cumulative records of pupils
 these records when systematically maintained provide much information about the children which the teacher can use in guidance instruction grouping and reporting to parents
 each teacher has in his classroom a metal file equipped with a lock which is used to store cumulative record folders
 during summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of the principal
 only the teacher and other professional personnel are permitted to see or use these records
 each new teacher to whom the pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date 7
 some school systems provide written instructions to principals and teachers designating when certain information is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how the information is to be summarized and used
 the summary report on desegregation progress in education in the middle-south region 1959-1960 clearly shows two pieces of information
 the summary report which was prepared for this conference indicates first that actual or pending school desegregation is increasing; second that both actual and pending desegregation is with few exceptions the product or result of court order 4
 the report together with other information suggests that desegregation in the schools is slow
 the middle-south region as defined by the national association of intergroup relations officials consists of the states of kentucky maryland tennessee west virginia delaware virginia and the district of columbia
 the states and the nation's capital all have some desegregation in fact some dating back to 1954; but the region also embraces some of the staunchest opposition
 desegregation has been opposed by massive resistance interposition pupil assignment and hate bombings
 now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation and such increase as a result of court order 11
 elementary school desegregation came to owen and union counties which already had high school desegregation
 the action was a result of a court order the citation for which is taken from the summary report for this conference 8
 in maryland the harford county board of education had prepared a desegregation plan which the court approved but which a plaintiff had challenged; thus county school board and federal court joined hands here to promote school desegregation
 additional school desegregation in tennessee resulted from a court order opening a school serving children of military personnel 6
 similarly further desegregation may come from suits pending in three tennessee cities chattanooga knoxville and memphis 5
 in west virginia the number of white and negro children attending the same school has increased almost twofold
 there are no court decisions here
 as in maryland a district court has approved an official plan of school desegregation in delaware
 as a result of the state board of education plan negro children entered heretofore white elementary schools in five districts 9
 the third circuit court of appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan
 in virginia court orders led to desegregation in charlottesville and floyd counties
 desegregation in pulaski county is pending because of court order although date of admission is not yet determined
 negro parents have filed application for admission of additional children to schools in alexandria arlington fairfax and warren counties
 desegregation can also result from additional suits brought by negro plaintiffs against school boards in newport news fairfax county arlington county and norfolk
 as a school district the district of columbia has had desegregated schools since 1954 shortly after the supreme court decision 8
 this recapitulation makes it clear that school desegregation continues including the old dominion state in spite of its stern resistance
 the record is clear that increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result of a court order; that on the immediate horizon if further large-scale desegregation comes it will result from court orders on suits filed in several middle-south states 4
 knowledge that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow
 before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at this regional conference i wish to note a small item in the summary report as it refers to the district of columbia
 that reference in the report is continuation of the trend toward an all-negro school system a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of negro school population from 74
 1 per cent to 76
 i see no real prospects for an all-negro school population 10
 west of rock creek park is still monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white as a result of georgetown's conversion- by-renovation housing program
 nearby foggy bottom is ousting negroes
 the large acreage in the southwest redevelopment area beckons white people- what with high-priced town houses and elevator apartments
 the capitol hill rehabilitation like foggy bottom replaces negroes with whites 
 the sharpest break with tradition the past and present of white ring around a black core may come with the opening of nearby montgomery county suburbs to negro residents and presumably the consequent conclusion of some whites that they cannot escape the negro by fleeing to the suburbs
 in fact short of fleeing to warrenton virginia or rockville maryland white people may have to live with negroes 11
 all of this must be taken into account before the image of an all-negro dc public school system is conjured up
 solve from the summary report before us at this conference a number of problems are apparent
 they vex us and perplex us but generally do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems
 first how can we step up the desegregation movement? 10
  it is slow
 i believe we all want more schools where white and negro together can and do attend
 i believe we all want no child denied admission to a school on account of his color
 in general members of nairo would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence or within his residence zone 8
 how to achieve this objective is a problem but we are not divided on what we want
 second as we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves how can we achieve this action through school board action? 7
  it may be county school board or state school board action as well as that of municipal school boards
 correlatively can we reduce the role of the district courts so that the action is that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court? 8
  this is a problem and i believe there is little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and effect a plan of desegregation
 third how can we insure a systematic and continuing group relations education in the schools? 8
  not simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but a continuing program that also promotes integration that encourages the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or negro but as human beings
 again the problem is how to get it done and in what form to offer the group relations education; not whether it should be done 9
 fourth in the segregated school system during the period before desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity? 5
  in fact in the desegregated school system which may have a good many schools with all-negro population how can we assure equal opportunity? 6
  this is a problem but we are not divided over its importance or by its existence
 fifth in the segregated school system or in the all-negro or all-white schools how can we encourage better group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong to the group? 6
  can we help children adjust to images of other children when the latter are not actually present
 if we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively united fashion then there are twice as many issues which i judge sharply issue since on the one hand school desegregation has come in virginia hand- in-glove with pupil assignment shall we support the plan? 7
  on the basis of pupil assignment criteria judge albert bryan has assigned negro children to formerly white schools in arlington and alexandria virginia
 shall we support pupil assignment? 12
  on the other hand looking at the larger picture is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off blocked or reduced school desegregation to a trickle? 7
  shall we therefore oppose the plan? 10
  this question is an issue because it likely divides issue no 2 8
 in large cities like baltimore louisville and washington dc should school desegregation be extended to all-negro and all-white schools by assigning white and negro teachers respectively? 7
  on the one hand do we argue the supreme court decision required only that a child not be denied admission to a school on account of his race? 7
  or should we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different races and that that is impossible in an all-something- or-the-other school we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school namely to a teacher of another race
 we can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated issue no 3
 the earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that resulted in desegregation
 in each instance the plaintiff was a private citizen 11
 in thousands of school districts indeed in the entire state of mississippi no plaintiff has come forth
 and i have established that the action of municipal county or state school boards or boards of education is small infinitesimally small in comparison with the number of districts
 is the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement? 9
  should congress authorize the attorney general to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance? 0
  even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the attorney general to act was eliminated should we nevertheless support such a clause? 6
  this is an issue for it divides issue no 4
 withholding of funds to schools that deny children on account of race
 which in 1957 divided even a liberal group like the american veterans committee
 should we support a clause in federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a child on account of his race? 6
  this is softer than earlier powell amendments which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts
 there is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause softened though it be on the grounds that federal aid is so necessary to the public schools
 the federal funds limitation enlists the support issue no 5 8
 state or county or municipality be required to furnish public education? 9
  for the school year 1959-1960 the prince edward county board of supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education and the school board therefore could provide no public education- for white or negro children
 is public education in this american democracy of such importance that no child should be denied public education? 8
  or is this subject a matter of self-determination a matter of states rights or county rights? 7
  if people don't want to provide public education should they be forced to do so? 9
  even if we marshal substantial agreement behind mandatory public education we likely cannot expect that all the states will enact the legislation
 should the requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be legislated by the united states congress? 8
  or must it become law by amendment of the united states constitution? 8
  we actually have two issues issue no 6
 federal responsibility if the above issue is settled by requiring public education for all citizens issue no 6 may be moot 5
 if on the other hand it is not settled or while it is being debated and resolved does the federal government have a responsibility in situations like that in prince edward county? 9
  nearly half the children still receive no education 7
 must or should the federal government help? 11
  should the government directly provide education for the children who want public education? 6
  the next question is whether board members favor their own social classes in their roles as educational policy-makers 7
 on the whole it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit way
 seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly drawn
 a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately but was too expensive for working-class youth 5
 in situations of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education
 campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve western cities over the period of 1931-40 and found little or no relationship between certain social and economic factors and school board competence as judged by a panel of professional educators who studied the voting records on educational issues
 the few cases of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay increases for teachers and such issues are not issues of educational policy
 in general it appears that trustees and board members attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of educational policy and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant values of the society are middle-class values which are generally thought to be valid for the entire society
 there have been very few cases of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy
 if there were more such cases it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers favor their own social classes 9
 there is currently a major controversy of public education in which group interests and values are heavily engaged 11
 this is the issue of segregated schools in the south 13
 in this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial groups rather than social-class groups
 thus the white middle and lower classes are arrayed against the negro middle and lower classes
 this conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class people better than it suits white lower-class people 8
 if this happens there may be some class conflict in the south with school boards and school teachers taking the middle-class position 7
 profession the members of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy their position being strongest in the universities
 they are mostly upper-middle- and lower-middle-class people with a few in the upper class
 do they make class-biased decision s? 18
    in a society dominated by middle-class values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens these social values it is clear that the educational profession must work for the values which are characteristic of the society
 there is no problem here
 the problem arises if it does arise when the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his professional competence but which bears some relation to the social structure 6
 for instance in giving school grades or in making recommendations for the award of a college scholarship does he consciously or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class? 8
  again in deciding on the content and method of his teaching does he favor a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the race for higher economic status or does he favor a curriculum which strengthens students in other ways? 4
    the answers to questions such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's own social-class position and also upon his social history as well as upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator
 in a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class backgrounds wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as well as on his social-class background
 one upward-mobile teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb while another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations at home and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment
 one social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families
 their own experience in the social system influences their work and attitudes as teachers
 while this influence is a complex matter depending upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his social-class experience there probably are some general statements about social-class background and educational policy that can be made with a fair degree of truth
 teachers who have been upward mobile probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves students as it has served them; that is they are likely to favor a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value
 this does not necessarily mean that such teachers will favor vocational education as contrasted with liberal education but they are likely to favor an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement value as against a kind of pure liberal education that is not designed to help people get better jobs
 there is no doubt that higher education since world war 2 has moved away from pure liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and specialization
 there are several causes for this one being rapid economic development with increasing numbers of middle-class positions requiring engineering or scientific training
 but another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their own use of education as a means of social advancement
 compared with the college and university faculty members of the period from 1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty members consist of more children of immigrants and more children of urban working-class fathers
 their experience is quite in contrast with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born parents who are more likely to regard education as good for its own sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum
 public interest groups educational policies are formed by several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in the public interest
 legislators are one such group and state legislators have major responsibility for educational legislation
 they generally vote so as to serve their own constituency and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class they might be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests in education
 however there are relatively few such political constituencies and as has been pointed out there is seldom a clear-cut distinction between the educational interests of one social class and those of another
 another public interest group is the commission of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem and to make recommendations
 generally these commissions work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society as they conceive it
 nevertheless their conclusions and recommendations cannot please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view
 for instance there have been two presidential commissions on higher education since world war 2
 president truman's commission on higher education tended to take a liberal expansionist position while president eisenhower's committee on education beyond the high school was slightly more conservative 5
 both commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people who attempted to act in the public interest
 an example of a more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the commission on the financing of higher education sponsored by the association of american universities and supported by the rockefeller foundation and the carnegie corporation
 this commission recommended against the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships
 this might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias but the commission published as one of its staff studies a book by byron s hollingshead entitled who should go to college? 7
  which recommended a federal government scholarship program 9
 furthermore the commission set up the council for financial aid to education as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support of private higher education
 thus the commission acted with a sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions about the problem of government support to private education
 then there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by their support or refusal to support various educational programs experiments and demonstrations
 these people are practically always upper- or upper-middle-class persons who attempt to act in what they regard as the interest of the entire society
 finally there are the parent organizations and the laymen's organizations such as the national association of parents and teachers and the citizens committee on public schools
 these have an upper-middle-class leadership and a middle-class membership with rare exceptions where working- class parents are active in local p-ta matters
 like the other policy-making groups these are middle class in their educational attitudes and they attempt to act in the general public interest as they see it
 in general it appears that educational decisions and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the interests of the society as a whole
 they are predominantly middle- and upper-class people and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes of those classes 6
 they may be unaware of the existence of lower-class values and consequently fail to take them into account
 but there is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education
 they think of themselves as trustees for the entire society and try to serve the entire society
 structure through education educational policy in the united states has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity
 in so far as this goal is achieved the society becomes more fluid artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced and people at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society
 on the other hand there is a counterbalancing purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages of the parents to their children
 this leads to efforts at exclusiveness through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification in the schools 11
 both of these purposes exist side by side without much overt conflict under present conditions
 cultural opportunity the broad expansion of free education results both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promoting fluidity within the social structure 6
 fifty years ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an example of this movement
 during the past decade the program has been carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities state colleges and community colleges
 the reaffirmation of american faith in the comprehensive high school as expressed in the conant study is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity
 the recent federal government's student-loan program is another step in the direction of making higher education more available to lower-status youth
 it is probably more effective than the expanded scholarship programs of the past decade because the scholarship programs mainly aided the students with the best academic records and these students tended to use the scholarship funds to go to more expensive colleges 7
 meanwhile the private colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds
 the gains in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place largely in the publicly supported institutions 7
 unfortunately however and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues 7
 and this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service
 one such disagreement which will receive attention in this next chapter concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must be made directly proportional to marginal costs or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs
 here the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma 6
 of fully distributed cost analysis despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define relative costs the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice
 for more explicit expositions one must distinguish different types of analyses
 by all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution
 the first or double-step type might also be called the railroad type because of its application to railroads by the cost section of the interstate commerce commission
 the cost section distinguishes between variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter
 the variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing long-run out- of-pocket costs- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the economist's long-run marginal costs
 there remains a residue of total costs or total revenue requirements which since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis
 nevertheless because the cost section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs it has apportioned this residue which it sometimes calls burden among the units of carload traffic on a basis which is concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination
 in recent years this burden has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet
 since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the interstate commerce commission has estimated out- of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs
 suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable
 but in any event full credit should be given to the cost section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses: namely that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service; and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination
 we turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which unlike the railroad type draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment: the single-step type
 it might be called the public utility type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases
 here no attempt is made first to determine out- of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs reasonably distributed residues of total costs
 instead all of the total costs are treated as variable costs although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables
 moreover whereas in interstate commerce commission parlance variable cost means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion t o changes in rate of output in the type of analysis now under review variable cost has been used more broadly so as to cover costs which while a function of some one variable are not necessarily a linear function
 as already noted in an earlier paragraph the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service such as residential commercial industrial power street lighting etc
 this grand division permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class such as street lighting or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes 6
 high-tension industrial power service for example would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the low-tension distribution lines
 but the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all or nearly all classes of customers; and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs than can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates
 the general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis
 but before turning to this example we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type
 in the first subtype the analyst distributes both total operating costs and total annual capital costs among the different classes and units of service
 here an apportionment say of $5000000 of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capit al is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers
 but in the second subtype which i take to be the one more frequently applied only the operating expenses and not the cost of capital or fair return are apportioned directly among the various classes of service
 to be sure the capital investments in the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services 8
 but any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a return realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service
 thus during any given year if the revenues from the residential service are $7000000 if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to $5000000 and if the net investment in the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to $30000000 the cost analyst will report that residential service in the aggregate has yielded a return of $2000000 or 6-23 per cent 5
 other services will show different rates of return some probably much lower and some higher
 there are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding cost of capital from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service- notably the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute cost of capital or fair rate of return
 but the practice is likely to be misleading since it may seem to support a conclusion that as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus some return on capital investment however low the rates of charge for this service are compensatory
 needless to say any such inference would be quite unwarranted 9
 for the reason just suggested i shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example
 that is to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment
 of the costs of an electric utility business in order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utilit y company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant
 let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service all of which is supplied at the same voltage phase etc to residential commercial and industrial customers
 this latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis- the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions
 since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple; indeed that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption
 in fact however the problem is not so simple 15
 for a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output of energy
 a recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required 8
 the simplest division and the one most frequently used in gas and electric rate cases is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into customer costs energy or volumetric costs and demand or capacity costs
 if this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service as it actually does have in some rates there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service
 for example the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge a $5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hours of energy at 2 per kilowatt-hour and a $2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 per kilowatt- a total bill of $8 for that month
 but our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs
 let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative 1
 the these are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless or almost regardless of power consumption
 included as a minimum are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another consumer
 these minimum costs may come to $1 per month more or less for residential and small commercial customers although they are substantially higher for large industrial users who require more costly connections and metering devices
 while costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates in the form of a mere service charge they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment
 but the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of including not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary distribution system- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity
 the preconditions of sociology have remained largely unexamined by the sociologist
 like primitive numbers in mathematics the entire axiological framework is taken to rest upon its operational worth
 but what is the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduces the idea of physical models? 10
  is it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible meaning can be assigned to the most sacr ed canons in social science? 8
  it has become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of values by erecting mathematical and physical models is itself a conditioned response to a world which pays a premium price for technological manipulation
 this push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurements of parameters involved in differential equations has led sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word mass to mean a small group in which certain relations between all pairs of individuals in such a group can be studied
 here i think the role of the philosopher becomes apparent 14
 the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small groups needs to be questioned
 for if the small group notion involves the implicit claim that the phenomena of sociological investigations are of atomic or subatomic proportions the philosopher needs to know the extent to which such entities are valid
 the mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offers a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation
 a parallel function for philosophy is the study of the relation between perceptions experientially received and conceptions logically formed
 philosophy can supply adequate criteria of meaning in the selection of socially viable categories
 this involves a sifting of the empirical and rational elements entering into each social science statement
 merton's functional sociology may have great practical use in the study of different cultures yet it is perfectly clear as nagel and hempel indicate that the concept of function in sociology has been built up from physiological and biological models in which the notions of teleology ie metaphysical purpose are central
 functionalism as a sociological credo is therefore not a direct consequence of observations but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment
 the purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology is not to tyrannize but to clarify the principles of social science 9
 it is absurd to speak of philosophy as a superior enterprise to sociology since the former is a logical rational discipline where sociology is essentially descriptive and empirical
 such a position entails the negation of philosophy in its platonic form as something soaring above and embracing the empirical and mathematical sciences
 but contrary to whitehead philosophy is not a synonym for plato 11
 the uses of philosophy as a logical clearing house are manifest to any approach that does not descend to pure sensationalism 6
 however when philosophy attempts to stand above the sciences to dictate the conditions of empirical research it becomes formal metaphysics; shaping the contours of life to fit the needs of legends 6
 the notion of philosophy as queen bee may fit well with authoritarian modes of political ideology but it has been noted that the price of such an imperial notion of philosophy is the frustration and flagellation of the social sciences
 metaphysics is no longer a direct grappling with nature as it was in antiquity
 it has surrendered any claims of description in favor of psychological accounts of nothingness as in heidegger's system 8
 science is mocked for wishing to know nothing of nothing in a last ditch effort to save the gods at the expense of me n 7
 it is not positivism which has isolated metaphysics from reality by distinguishing between description and prescription 9
 it is simply revealing the state to which metaphysical thinking has fallen during this century
 consider the traditional four fields of philosophy: logic ethics epistemology and esthetics
 it is a commonplace that to the degree these special preserves of past philosophic hunting grounds establish an empirical content and suitable methodological criteria they move away from philosophy as such
 what is left to traditional systems of philosophy is in effect only the history of these fields prior to their becoming rigorous enough to abide by the canons of scientific method
 in this situation philosophy has survived by separating itself from metaphysics by showing the ultimate questions to be the meaningless questions
 the relinquishing by philosophy of pretentious claims to empirical priority gives it an ability to treat problems of meaning and truth which in the past it was unable to examine because of its missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble sorts 5
 in the new situation philosophy is able to provide the social sciences with the same guidance that mathematics offers the physical sciences a reservoir of logical relations that can be used in framing hypotheses having explanatory and predictive value
 beyond this philosophy may urge the social sciences forward by asking the type of question that falls outside the present scope of social inquiry but within its potential domain of relevance 4
 in this connection it might be noted that the theory of games was a mathematical discovery long before its uses in political science were exploited
 likewise kant formulated the nebular hypothesis according to which the solar system was evolved from a rotating mass of incandescent gas nearly a half century before its scientific value was made plain by laplace in his systeme du monde
 this does not mean that philosophy resolves the problems it generates any more so than riemann's geometry settled the physical status of the space-time continuum
 but the forceful presentation of new issues for the sciences to work on is itself a monumental task
 to those raised on marcel's homo viator and heidegger's das nichtige this may seem a modest role for philosophy
 however modesty and triviality are different qualities 8
 philosophy conceived of as servant to the sciences might appear as less dramatic than philosophy which jeers as the sciences evolve
 the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind has traversed since its primitive anthropological status offers a more durable sort of drama
 by clarifying fundamental premises in the social sciences and defining the logical problems emergent at the borderlands of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understanding
 philosophy can prevent the working scientist from becoming slothful and self-content by noting the assumptions and level at which a hypothesis or theory is framed
 the dissection of scientific theory the examination of a theory from the vantage-points of language epistemology and ethics is itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less so because of its removal from empirical research
 the realm of science whatever the degree of precision in formulations covers the range of prediction and explanation 6
 whatever philosophy is conceived to be its rationalist logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it is something other than science
 for some forms of philosophy this very division between the empirical and the rational becomes a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter
 bergson and leroy announce that the secret is the center of a philosophy and thereafter a hundred followers declare secrecy a higher verity
 this is simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruced up to look virtuous
 for as merleau-ponty indicated it is not the secret which is important but the removal of secrecy
 in this philosophy and science share a common goal 11
 the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantees that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophies shall not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument; for this division is but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science
 the mystification of metaphysical systems does not imply the demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic age which demanded metaphysics to be rational and logical
 the tenacity with which present metaphysical attitudes fetishize private intuition offers the strongest evidence that the gulf between scientific and delphic ways of philosophizing is built into the present conflict over the limits and purpose of science religion and ideology 6
 scientific systems and this includes even the relation of mechanist to relativist physics are built upon refined and corrected 5
 philosophic systems by the very nature of their completeness are overthrown by rival systems
 in addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysics they differ in that science is essentially descriptive while philosophy in its inherited forms tends to be goal-oriented teleological and prescriptive
 the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour is not subject to objective analysis has placed intuitive metaphysics squarely against the sociology of knowledge since it is precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat beliefs as social facts no less viable than social behaviour
 when dealing with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or better the role of philosophy in assisting research on the social sources of ideas one has to become necessarily selective
 certain features we have touched upon: philosophy as a logical deductive system from which a social science methodology can be built up; philosophic analysis of the assumptions and presumptions of the social sciences; and philosophy as a guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological investigations
 the objection will be raised that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science has been omitted namely the status of ultimate value questions and norms operative in the social sciences
 specifically it will be asked whether the real questions people ask are not the ultimate questions that social science finds itself impotent in the face of
 what then is the status of such questions as: is society the ground of human existence or a means to an individual goal? 6
  do societies develop according to cosmic patterns or are they subject only to the free choice of individuals? 9
  does society really exist as an entity over and above the agglomeration of men? 5
  i think it must be said that contrary to metaphysical insistence these are questions so framed as to defy either empirical exploration or rational solutions
 as simmel and dilthey indicated questions of whether the value of life is individual or social are not questions but assertions of faith made to appear as legitimate questions
 such pseudo-questions assume that answers of concrete significance can be supplied to statements involving undefined universals
 social theory has no more right to expect results from meaningless questions than physics has the right to expect a theological solution to the wave-particle controversy
 it is not that such questions are not asked 17
 it is rather that introducing them into social analysis reflects not so much a search for truth as for certainty 9
 an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty since it is certainty which every new discovery in science either replaces or reshapes
 to raise the added objection that men require certainty on psychological grounds answers to ultimate questions having an irrational rather than scientific basis is in a real sense to undermine the objection itself
 for what concerns all scientific disciplines is precisely that which can be captured for the rational ie for the scientific determination of what in past ages was considered ultimate and irrational
 a philosophy which attempts to supply ultimate answers in an ultimate way reveals its acquiescence in the shortcomings of men an impatience with partial tentative solutions
 men have always lived in a tentative world and in suspension of ultimate judgments where and when necessary
 uncertainty overcoming itself is the precondition of the quest for new and more precise information about the world
 without such uncertainty we are left with a set of dogmas and myths
 the functional interplay of philosophy and science should as a minimum guarantee a meaningful option to myth-making 6
 a degree of indefiniteness is a salutary condition for the growth of science
 but neither was the statement empirical for goodness was not a quality like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard 7
 what were they to do then with these awkward judgments of value? 9
  to find a place for them in their theory of knowledge would require them to revise the theory radically and yet that theory was what they regarded as their most important discovery
 it appeared that the theory could be saved in one way only 11
 if it could be shown that judgments of good and bad were not judgments at all that they asserted nothing true or false but merely expressed emotions like hurrah or fiddlesticks then these wayward judgments would cease from troubling and weary heads could be at rest 5
 this is the course the positivists took
 they explained value judgments by explaining them away 7
 now i do not think their view will do
 but before discussing it i should like to record one vote of thanks to them for the clarity with which they have stated their case 6
 it has been said of john stuart mill that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out
 this theory has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism of the same kind and this i will do my best to supply 6
 the theory claims to show by analysis that when we say that is good we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we are thinking
 i shall argue that we do mean to do just that
 let us work through an example and the simpler and commoner the better
 there is perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain is bad 8
 let us take a set of circumstances in which i happen to be interested on the legislative side and in which i think every one of us might naturally make such a statement
 we come upon a rabbit that has been caught in one of the brutal traps in common use
 there are signs that it has struggled for days to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it has all but eaten off its own leg
 the attempt failed: the animal is now dead
 as we think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffered we are very likely to say: it was a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so
 the positivist tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion
 i hold on the contrary that we mean to assert something of the pain itself namely that it was bad- bad when and as it occurred 10
 consider what follows from the positivist view 12
 on that view nothing good or bad happened in the case until i came on the scene and made my remark
 for what i express in my remark is something going on in me at the time and that of course did not exist until i did come on the scene 6
 the pain of the rabbit was not itself bad; nothing evil was happening when that pain was being endured; badness in the only sense in which it is involved at all waited for its appearance till i came and looked and felt
 now that this is at odds with our meaning may be shown as follows 5
 let us put to ourselves the hypothesis that we had not come on the scene and that the rabbit never was discovered
 are we prepared to say that in that case nothing bad occurred in the sense in which we said it did? 8
  clearly not
 indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident of our later discovery made no difference whatever to the badness of the animal's pain that it would have been every whit as bad whether a chance passer-by happened later to discover the body and feel repugnance or not
 if so then it is clear that in saying the suffering was bad we are not expressing our feelings only
 we are saying that the pain was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude toward it
 the first argument is thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference
 it removes our present expression and shows that the badness we meant would not be affected by this whereas on positivist grounds it should be
 the second argument applies the method in the reverse way 11
 it ideally removes the past event and shows that this would render false what we mean to say whereas on positivist grounds it should not 6
 let us suppose that the animal did not in fact fall into the trap and did not suffer at all but that we mistakenly believe it did and say as before that its suffering was an evil thing 7
 on the positivist theory everything i sought to express by calling it evil in the first case is still present in the second 6
 in the only sense in which badness is involved at all whatever was bad in the first case is still present in its entirety since all that is expressed in either case is a state of feeling and that feeling is still there
 and our question is is such an implication consistent with what we meant? 7
  clearly it is not
 if anyone asked us after we made the remark that the suffering was a bad thing whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident had never occurred and no pain had been suffered at all we should say that it made all the difference in the world that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering we thought had occurred back there that if this had not occurred there was nothing left to be bad and that our assertion was in that case mistaken
 the suggestion that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering seems to me merely frivolous 6
 if we did not mean to say this why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering had not occurred? 7
  on the theory before us such relief would be groundless for in that suffering itself there was nothing bad at all and hence in its nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieved about 7
 the positivist theory would here distort our meaning beyond recognition
 so far as i can see there is only one way out for the positivist 20
 he holds that goodness and badness lie in feelings of approval or disapproval
 and there is a way in which he might hold that badness did in this case precede our own feeling of disapproval without belonging to the pain itself
 the pain in itself was neutral; but unfortunately the rabbit on no grounds at all took up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that made it for the first time and in the only intelligible sense bad
 this way of escape is theoretically possible but since it has grave difficulties of its own and has not so far as i know been urged by positivists it is perhaps best not to spend time over it 7
 i come now to a third argument which again is very simple 7
 when we come upon the rabbit and make our remark about its suffering being a bad thing we presumably make it with some feeling; the positivists are plainly right in saying that such remarks do usually express feeling
 but suppose that a week later we revert to the incident in thought and make our statement again
 and suppose that the circumstances have now so changed that the feeling with which we made the remark in the first place has faded 8
 the pathetic evidence is no longer before us; and we are now so fatigued in body and mind that feeling is as we say quite dead 5
 in these circumstances since what was expressed by the remark when first made is on the theory before us simply absent the remark now expresses nothing
 it is as empty as the word hurrah would be when there was no enthusiasm behind it
 and this seems to me untrue
 when we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing the feeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the vanishing point but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before we should certainly answer yes
 we should say that we made our point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the second time but that it was the same point we were making
 and if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same while the feeling varies from intensity to near zero it is not the feeling that we primarily meant to express
 i come now to a fourth consideration
 we all believe that toward acts or effects of a certain kind one attitude is fitting and another not; but on the theory before us such a belief would not make sense
 broad and ross have lately contended that this fitness is one of the main facts of ethics and i suspect they are right
 but that is not exactly my point
 my point is this: whether there is such fitness or not we all assume that there is and if we do we express in moral judgments more than the subjectivists say we do
 in his novel the house of the dead dostoevsky tells of his experiences in a siberian prison camp
 whatever the unhappy inmates of such camps are like today dostoevsky's companions were about as grim a lot as can be imagined 6
 i have heard stories he writes of the most terrible the most unnatural actions of the most monstrous murders told with the most spontaneous childishly merry laughter
 most of us would say that in this delight at the killing of others or the causing of suffering there is something very unfitting 9
 if we were asked why we thought so we should say that these things involve great evil and are wrong and that to take delight in what is evil or wrong is plainly unfitting
 now on the subjectivist view this answer is ruled out 11
 for before someone takes up an attitude toward death suffering or their infliction they have no moral quality at all 5
 there is therefore nothing about them to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fitting
 they are in themselves neutral and so far as they get a moral quality they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude of the onlooker
 but if that is true why is any attitude more fitting than any other? 11
  would applause for example be fitting if apart from the applause there were nothing good to applaud? 6
  would condemnation be fitting if independently of the condemnation there were nothing bad to condemn? 8
  in such a case any attitude would be as fitting or unfitting as any other which means that the notion of fitness has lost all point 6
 indeed we are forced to go much farther
 if goodness and badness lie in attitudes only and hence are brought into being by them those men who greeted death and misery with childishly merry laughter are taking the only sensible line 5
 if there is nothing evil in these things if they get their moral complexion only from our feeling about them why shouldn't they be greeted with a cheer? 9
  to greet them with repulsion would turn what before was neutral into something bad; it would needlessly bring badness into the world; and even on subjectivist assumptions that does not seem very bright 5
 on the other hand to greet them with delight would convert what before was neutral into something good; it would bring goodness into the world
 the injured german veteran was a former miner twenty-four years old who had been wounded by shrapnel in the back of the head 8
 this resulted in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the left side of the cerebellum also
 in any event the extraordinary result of this injury was that he became psychically blind while at the same time apparently the sense of touch remained essentially intact
 psychical blindness is a condition in which there is a total absence of visual memory-images a condition in which for example one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in his absence
 this circumstance in the patient's case plus the fact that his tactual capacity remained basically in sound working order constitutes its exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence presented by the authors is overwhelming that when the patient closed his eyes he had absolutely no spatial awareness whatsoever 5
 the necessary inference as the authors themselves interpret it would seem to be this:  spatial qualities are not among those grasped by the sense of touch as such
 we do not arrive at spatial images by means of the sense of touch by itself
 spatiality becomes part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representations; that is there is in the true sense only a visual space
 the underlying assumption of course is that only sight and touch enable us in any precise and fully dependable way to locate objects in space beyond us the other senses being decidedly inferior if not totally inadequate in this regard
 this is an assumption with which few would be disposed to quarrel 13
 therefore if the sense of touch is functioning normally and there is a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eyes are closed and an object is handled the conclusion seems unavoidable that touch by itself cannot focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of things and that actual sight or visual representations are necessary
 the force of the authors' analysis can be felt by the reader i believe only after three questions have been successfully answered 7
 what allows us to think that the patient had no third-dimensional representations when his eyes were closed? 6
  what evidence is there that he was psychically blind? 13
  how can we be sure that his sense of touch was not profoundly disturbed by his head injury? 8
  we shall consider these in the inverse order of their presentation
 obviously a satisfactory answer to the third question is imperative if the argument is to get under way at all for if there is any possibility of doubt whether the patient's tactual sensitivity had been impaired by the occipital lesion any findings whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether of course as evidence to establish the desired conclusion 5
 the answer the authors give to it therefore is of supreme importance
 it is as follows: the usual sensitivity tests showed that the specific qualities of skin-perceptiveness as well as the kinesthetic sensations were as such essentially intact although they seemed in comparison with normal reactions to be somewhat diminished over the entire body
 the supposed tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and his ability to specify the location of a member as well as the direction and scope of a movement passively executed proved to have been on the contrary very considerably affected
 the authors insist however that these abnormalities in the sense of touch were due absolutely to no organic disorders in that sense faculty but rather to the injuries which the patient had sustained to the sense of sight
 first of all what is their evidence that the tactual apparatus was fundamentally undamaged? 10
  wh en an object was placed in the patient's hand he had no difficulty determining whether it was warm or cold sharp or blunt rough or smooth flexible soft or hard; and he could tell simply by the feel of it whether it was made of wood iron cloth rubber and so on 5
 and he could recognize by touch alone articles which he had handled immediately before even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him; that is he was unaware what kind of objects they were or what their use was
 the patient attained an astonishing efficiency in a new trade 9
 because of his brain injury and the extreme damage suffered to his sight the patient had to train himself for a new line of work that of a portfolio-maker an occupation requiring a great deal of precision in the making of measurements and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour
 it seems clear when one takes into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient second question the one concerning the psychical blindness of the that he had to rely on his sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty was most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision
 and so the authors conclude: the conduct of the patient in his every-day life and in his work even more than the foregoing facts mentioned above under 1 leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word was unaffected; or to put the same thing in physiological terms that the performance-capacity of the tactual apparatus from the periphery up to the tactual centers in the brain- that is from one end to the other- was unimpaired 7
 if the argument is accepted as essentially sound up to this point it remains for us to consider whether the patient's difficulties in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects in space with the sense of touch can be explained by his defective visual condition 5
 but before we can do this we must first find answers to our original questions 1 and 2; then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand 8
 in what ways then did the patient's psychical blindness manifest itself? 10
  he could not see objects as unified self-contained and organized figures as a person does with normal vision
 the meaning of this as we shall see is that he had no fund of visual memory-images of objects as objects; and therefore he could not recognize even long-familiar things upon seeing them again 6
 instead he constantly became lost in parts and components of them confused some of their details with those of neighboring objects and so on unless he allowed time to trace the object in question through minute movements of the head and hands and in this way to discover its contours
 according to his own testimony he never actually saw things as shaped but only as generally amorphous blots of color of a more or less indefinite size; at their edges they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether
 but by the tracing procedure he could in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner find the unseen form; could piece as it were the jumbled mass together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man or a triangle or whatever it turned out to be
 if however the figure to be discerned were complicated composed of several interlocking subfigures and so on even the tracing process failed him and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes among its parts
 this meant concretely that the patient could not read at all without making writing-like movements of the head or body became easily confused by hasher marks inserted between hand-written words and thus confused the mark for one of the letters and could recognize a simple straight line or a curved one only by tracing it 7
 the patient himself denied that he had any visual imagery at all; and there was ample evidence of the following sort to corrobora te him
 after a conversation with another man he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man looked like
 nor could he call up memory-pictures of close friends or relatives
 in short both his own declarations and his figural blindness when he looked at objects seem to present undeniable evidence that he had simply no visual memory at all
 he was oblivious of the form of the object actually being viewed precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learned and held in visual memory as persons of normal vision do 6
 he could not recognize it; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory at all
 therefore his only recourse was to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object; and this he could do only by going over its mass with the tracing procedure
 then he might finally recognize it apparently by combining the visual blot actually being seen with tactual feelings in the head or body accompanying the tracing movements
 this would mean it can readily be seen that again for each new visual experience the tracing motions would have to be repeated because of the absence of visual imagery
 as one would surmise the procedure however could be repeated with the same object or with the same type of object often enough so that the corresponding visual blots and the merest beginning of the tracing movement would provide clues as to the actual shape which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference 7
 men trees automobiles houses and so on- objects continually confronted in everyday life- had each its characteristic blot-appearance and became easily recognizable at the very beginning of tracing by a n inference as to what each was
 dice for example he inferred from black dots on a white surface 7
 he evidently could not actually see the corners of these objects but their size and the dots gave them away
 and the authors give numerous instances of calculated guessing on the patient's part to show how large a role it played in his process of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it 6
 often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly without the tracing motions solely on the basis of qualitative differences among the blot-like things which appeared in his visual experience 5
 perhaps the very important question- what is then exactly the role of kinesthetic sensations in the patient's ability to recognize forms and shapes by means of the tracing movements when he is actually looking at things? 8
 - has now been raised in the reader's mind and in the following form
 if the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually then it would seem the sense of touch has immediate contact with the spatial aspects of things in independence of visual representatio ns at least in regard to two dimensions and as we shall see even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch is denied by the authors
 how then do the kinesthetic sensations function in all this? 7
  the authors set about answering this fundamental question through a detailed investigation of the patient's ability tactually to perceive figure and to locate objects in space with his eyes closed
 quite naturally they make the investigation first by prohibiting the patient from making any movements at all and then later by repeating it and allowing the patient to move in any way he wanted to 5
 when the patient was not allowed to move his body in any way at all the following striking results occurred
 whenever artists indeed turned to actual representations or molded three-dimensional figures which were rare down to 800 bc they tended to reflect reality; a schematic abstract treatment of men and animals by intent rose only in the late eighth century 4
 to speak of this underlying view of the world is to embark upon matters of subjective judgment
 at the least however one may conclude that geometric potters sensed a logical order; their principles of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric epics and the hexameter line
 their world again was a still simple traditional age which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity of life 6
 and perhaps an observer of the vases will not go too far in deducing that the outlook of their makers and users was basically stable and secure
 the storms of the past had died away and the great upheaval which was to mark the following century had not yet begun to disturb men's minds
 throughout the work of the later ninth century a calm severe serenity displays itself
 in the vases this spirit may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction but the best of the geometric pins have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the greek world
 the ninth century was in its artistic work the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past and future and the loving skill spent by its artists upon their products is a testimonial to their sense that what they were doing was important and was appreciated 5
 geometric pottery has not yet received the thorough detailed study which it deserves partly because the task is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations as at argos are only now coming to light
 from even a cursory inspection of its many aspects however the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusions about the progress of the aegean world down to 800 bc   the general intellectual outlook which had appeared in the eleventh century was now consolidated to a significant degree
 much which was in embryo in 1000 had become reasonably well developed by 800
 in this process the minoan-mycenaean inheritance had been transmuted or finally rejected; the aegean world which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision after 800
 those modern scholars who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from earliest times- granted occasional irruptions of peoples and ideas from outside- are correct; but all too many observers have been misled by this fact into minimizing the degree of change which took place in the early first millennium
 the focus of novelty in this world now lay in the south-eastern districts of the greek mainland and by 800 virtually the entire aegean always excepting its northern shores had accepted the geometric style of pottery
 while protogeometric vases usually turn up especially outside greece proper together with as many or more examples of local stamp these non-greek patterns had mostly vanished by the later ninth century 6
 in their place came local variations within the common style- tentative as it were in protogeometric products but truly distinct and sharply defined as the geometric spirit developed 5
 attica though important was not the only teacher of this age 10
 one can take a vase of about 800 bc and without any knowledge of its place of origin venture to assign it to a specific area; imitation and borrowing of motifs now become ascertainable 5
 the potters of the aegean islands thus stood apart from those of the mainland and in greece itself argive corinthian attic boeotian and other geometric sequences have each their own hallmarks 7
 these local variations were to become ever sharper in the next century and a half
 the same conclusions can be drawn from the other physical evidence of the dark ages from linguistic distribution and from the survivals of early social political and religious patterns into later ages
 by 800 bc the aegean was an area of common tongue and of common culture
 on these pillars rested that solid basis for life and thought which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad
 everywhere within the common pattern however one finds local diversity; greek history and culture were enduringly fertilized and plagued by the interplay of these conjoined yet opposed factors
 further we cannot go for the dark ages deserve their name 8
 many aspects of civilization were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundations of this world support a lofty structure
 the epic poems the consolidation of the greek pantheon the rise of firm political units the self-awareness which could permit painted and sculptured representations of men- all these had to await the progress of following decades
 what we have seen in this chapter we have seen only dimly and yet the results however general are worth the search
 these are the centuries in which the inhabitants of the aegean world settled firmly into their minds and into their institutions the foundations of the hellenic outlook independent of outside forces 6
 to interpret indeed the era from 1000 to 800 as a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect born of our lack of detailed information; if we could see more deeply we probably would find many side issues and wrong turnings which came to an end within the period
 the historian can only point out those lines which were major enough to find reflection in our limited evidence and must hope that future excavations will enrich our understanding
 throughout the dark ages it is clear the greek world had been developing slowly but consistently
 the pace could now be accelerated for the inhabitants of the aegean stood on firm ground
 the landscape of greek history broadens widely and rather abruptly in the eighth century bc the age of homer's rosy-fingered dawn 6
 the first slanting rays of the new day cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows which lie across the aegean world; but our evidence grows considerably in variety and shows more unmistakably some of the lines of change
 for this period as for earlier centuries pottery remains the most secure source; the ceramic material of the age is more abundant more diversified and more indicative of the hopes and fears of its makers who begin to show scenes of human life and death 5
 figurines and simple chapels presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in greece; objects in gold ivory and bronze grow more numerous
 since writing was practiced in the aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the details of tradition will now be occasionally useful
 though it is not easy to apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era this marvelous product of the epic tradition had certainly taken definitive shape by 750
 the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad are amazing manifestations of the inherent potentialities of greek civilization; but both were among the last products of a phase which was ending 5
 greek civilization was swirling toward its great revolution in which the developed qualities of the hellenic outlook were suddenly to break forth
 the revolution was well under way before 700 bc and premonitory signs go back virtually across the century
 the era however is janus-faced
 while many tokens point forward the main achievements stand as a culmination of the simple patterns of the dark ages 5
 the dominant pottery of the century was geometric; political organization revolved about the basileis; trade was just beginning to expand; the gods who protected the greek countryside were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress
 the modern student who knows what was to come next is likely to place first the factors of change which are visible in the eighth century
 not all men of the period would have accepted this emphasis 13
 many potters clung to the past the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas; the poet of the iliad deliberately archaized
 although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decades of the eighth century and shall interpret them as an apogee of the first stage of greek civilization
 on this principle of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture architecture society and politics; for the developments in these areas make sense only if they are connected to the age of revolution itself
 the growing contacts between aegean and orient are also a phase which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening of hellenic culture after 750
 we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections to the east as we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic and the myth and the religious evolution of early greece; the important point however is that these magnificent achievements unlike those of later decades were only incidentally influenced by oriental models
 the antecedents of dipylon vases and of the iliad lie in the aegean past
 the pottery of the first half of the eighth century is commonly called ripe geometric
 the severe yet harmonious vases of the previous fifty years the strong geometric style of the late ninth century display as firm a mastery of the principles underlying geometric pottery; but artists now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance 6
 the vases which resulted had different shapes far more complex decoration and a larger sense of style
 beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broader lines 6
 in earlier centuries men had had enough to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense of order after chaos
 they had had to work on very simple foundations and had not dared to give rein to impulses
 the potters in particular had virtually eschewed freehand drawing elaborate motifs and the curving lines of nature while yet expressing a belief that there was order in the universe
 in their vases were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics of greek civilization at first hesitantly in protogeometric work and then more confidently in the initial stages of the geometric style
 by 800 social and cultural security had been achieved at least on a simple plane; it was time to take bigger steps to venture on experiments
 ripe geometric potters continued to employ the old syntax of ornaments and shapes and made use of the well-defined though limited range of motifs which they had inherited
 in these respects the vases of the early eighth century represent a culmination of earlier lines of progress
 to the ancestral lore however new materials were added 11
 painters left less and less of a vase in a plain dark color; instead they divided the surface into many bands or covered it by all-over patterns into which freehand drawing began to creep 4
 wavy lines feather-like patterns rosettes of indefinitely floral nature birds either singly or in stylized rows animals in solemn frieze bands- all these turned up in the more developed fabrics as preliminary signs that the potters were broadening their gaze 6
 the rows of animals and birds in particular suggest awareness of oriental animal friezes transmitted perhaps via syrian silver bowls and textiles but the specific forms of these rows on local vases and metal products are nonetheless greek
 though the spread of this type of decoration in the aegean has not yet been precisely determined it seems to appear first in the cyclades which were among the leading exporters of pottery throughout the century
 as the material at the command of the potters grew and the volume of their production increased the local variations within a common style became more evident
 plate 12 illustrates four examples which are ripe or late geometric work of common spirit but of different schools 6
 cook had discovered a beef in his possession a few days earlier and when he could not show the hide arrested him
 thinking the evidence insufficient to get a conviction he later released him
 even while suffering the trip to his home cook swore to moore and lane that he would kill the indian
 three weeks later following his recovery armed with a writ issued by the catskill justice on affidavits prepared by the district attorney cook and russell rode to arrest martinez
 arriving at daybreak they found julio in his corral and demanded that he surrender
 instead he whirled and ran to his house for a gun forcing them to kill him cook reported
 both cook's and russell's lives were threatened by the mexicans following the killing but the company officers felt that in the end it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion 6
 general manager pels even suggested that it might be wise to keep the mexicans in suspense rather than accept their offers to sell out and move away and try to have a few punished
 on february 17 russell and cook were sent to the pena flor community on the vermejo to see about renting out ranches the company had purchased
 while talking with julian m beall francisco archuleta and juan marcus appeared both heavily armed and after watching the house for a while rode away
 it was nearly sundown before they finished the business with beall and began riding down the stream
 they had traveled only a short distance when they spotted five mexicans riding along a horse-trail across the stream just ahead of them
 suspecting an ambush the two deputies decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into catskill
 after spending two nights in catskill the deputies again headed for the vermejo to finish their business
 they stayed with a rancher friday night and by eleven o'clock saturday morning passed the old garnett lee ranch
 half a mile below at the mouth of salyer's canyon was an old ranch that the company had purchased from a j armstrong occupied by a mexican his wife and an old trapper
 there were three houses in salyer's canyon just at the foot of a low bluff the road winding along the top entering above and then passing down in front of the houses thence to the vermejo 6
 to the west of this road was another low bluff forty or fifty feet high covered with scrub oak and other brush
 as they were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the two bluffs a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers
 not a bullet touched cook who was nearer the ambush but one hit russell in the leg and another broke his arm passing on through his body
 with the first reports russell's horse wheeled to the right and ran towards the buildings while cook followed by a hail of bullets raced towards the arroyo of salyer's canyon immediately in front of him just reaching it as his horse fell
 grabbing his winchester from its sheath cook prepared to fight from behind the arroyo bank
 bullets were so thick throwing sand in his face that he found it difficult to return the fire
 noticing russell's horse in front of the long log building he assumed his friend had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight so he began working his way down the ditch to join him 7
 at a very shallow place two mexicans rushed into the open for a shot
 dropping to one knee cook felled one and the other struggled off with his comrade sending no further fire in his direction 7
 just before leaving the arroyo where he was partially concealed he did hear shots down at the house
 russell had reached the house as cook surmised dismounted but just as the old trapper opened the door to receive him he fell into the trapper's arms- dead
 a bullet fired by one of the mexicans hiding in a little chicken house had passed through his head tearing a hole two-inches square on the outgoing side
 finding him dead cook caught russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins
 before daylight sunday morning a posse of twenty-three men under the leadership of deputy sheriff frank macpherson of catskill followed the trail to the house of francisco chaves where 100 to 150 mexicans had gathered
 macpherson boldly approached the fortified adobe house and demanded entrance
 the men inside informed him that they had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid
 the officer demanded the names of the injured men; the mexicans not only refused to give them but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it
 since the strength of the mexicans had been underrated too small a posse had been collected and since the deputy had not been provided with search warrants macpherson and his men decided it was much wiser to withdraw
 the posse's retreat encouraged the mexicans to be overbearing and impudent
 during the following week six tons of hay belonging to one rancher were burned; some buildings farm tools two horses plows and hay owned by bonito lavato a friendly interpreter for the company and pedro chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed; and a store was broken into and robbed
 district attorney m w mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught committing these crimes or carrying arms- he just didn't catch anyone
 increasing threats on his life finally convinced cook that he should leave new mexico
 his friends advised that it would be only a question of time until either the mexicans killed him by ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense perpetuating the troubles 7
 by early summer he wrote from laramie that he was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad way financially so pels sent him a draft for $100 warning that it was still not wise for him to return
 pels also sent a check for $100 to russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his grave
 cattle stealing and killing again serious during the spring of 1891 placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing position 5
 they were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on the vermejo and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot 7
 and the law virtually ignored the situation
 the judge became ill just as the colfax district court convened no substitute was brought in no criminal cases heard only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual three weeks 6
 pels complained: litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business; public money spent; justice delayed; nothing accomplished and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to be an absolut e farce
 word reached the company that the man behind these depredations was manuel gonzales a man with many followers including a number who were kept in line through fear of him
 although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named asher jones the warrant for his arrest had never been served
 on may 19 a deputy sheriff's posse of eight men left maxwell city and rode thirty-five miles up the vermejo where they were joined by juan jose martinez
 by 3:00 am they reached his house and found it vacant 8
 when they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby they smashed down the door broke the window and threw lighted clothes wet with kerosene into the room
 still there was no gonzales and the family would say nothing 8
 about 300 yards up the creek was a cluster of mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a square
 while prowling around these buildings two of the posse recognized the voice of gonzales speaking to the people inside 6
 he was promised that no harm would befall him if he would come out but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door
 the posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him dead or alive
 in deadly earnest the besiegers methodically stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags inside only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit the floor
 when it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer taking a thousand to one chance gonzales rushed outside square against the muzzle of a winchester
 shot near the heart he turned to one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away three bullets following him 6
 as he pushed open the door he fell on his face one of his comrades pulling him inside
 not realizing the seriousness of the wound the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender the house would be burned down around him 8
 receiving no answer they set the fire
 when the house was about half consumed his comrade ran to the door and threw up his hands declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts of manuel
 finding it true that he was not inside the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed covered by a blanket
 several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand
 shot six or eight times the body was draped with russell's pistol belt and cartridges
 there was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who though numbering in the fifties had stood around on the hillside nearby without firing a shot during the entire attack
 early the next morning a mexican telephoned pels that celso chavez one of the posse members was surrounded by ten mexicans at his father's home on the upper vermejo
 the sheriff and district attorney mills hastily swore out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed according to signed statements by chavez and dr i p george and ordered deputy barney clark of raton to rescue the posseman 6
 traveling all night clark and twelve men arrived at about seven o'clock may 22
 occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a number of horsemen were sighted on the hills disappearing at the posse's approach
 a mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against chavez for taking part in the murder of manuel gonzales so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger
 the men helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to raton along with three other families desiring to leave
 the ten or more dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large and pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe houses defending themselves through loopholes it would be most difficult to capture them
 thus he wired j p lower and sons of denver: have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot? 6
  if not how long to order and what is the price? 11
  he wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup particularly since the mexicans were on their guard
 his problem then became one of restraining the american fighters who wanted to clean out the vermejo by force immediately 6
 the plant was located west of the battenkill and south of the location of the former electric light plant
 the manchester depot sewer company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction of a sewer in that locality and assessments were made for its maintenance
 it has given considerable trouble at times and empties right into the battenkill
 fire district no 1 discussed its possible purchase in 1945 but considered it an unwise investment
 the sewer on bonnet street was constructed when there were only a few houses on the street
 as new homes were built they were connected so that all residences south of school street are served by it
 b j connell is the present treasurer and manager 8
 the 1946 town meeting voted to have the selectmen appoint a committee to investigate and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and a disposal plant to serve manchester center depot and way's lane
 the committee submitted a report signed by louis martin and leon wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report
 the layout of the sewer lines was designed by henry w taylor who was the engineer for the manchester village disposal plant 5
 no figures were submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town
 the 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed sewage plant with its attendant facilities
 the final step was a vote for a $230000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by the 1959 town meeting later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special town meeting june 21 1960 6
 there the matter stands with the prospect that soon manchester may be removed from the roster of towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams
 telegraph manchester's unusual interest in telegraphy has often been attributed to the fact that the rev j d wickham headmaster of burr and burton seminary was a personal friend and correspondent of the inventor samuel f b morse
 at any rate manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system which was set up in 1844 between baltimore and washington
 in 1846 matthew b goodwin jeweler and watchmaker became the town's first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business two doors north of the equinox house or one door north of the bank manchester vermont
 goodwin was telegrapher for the american telegraph company and the troy and canada junction telegraph company
 shares of capital stock at $15 each in the latter company were payable at the bank of manchester or at various other vermont banks 6
 a message of less than fifteen words to bennington cost twenty-five cents
 by 1871 l c orvis manager of the western union telegraph company expressed willingness to send emergency telegrams on sundays from his village drugstore
 orvis even needed to hire an assistant clark j wait 6
 the manchester journal commented editorially on the surprising amount of local telegraphic business
 in the fall of 1878 the popular telegraph line was established between manchester and factory point by the owners paul w orvis henry gray j n hard and clark j wait
 the line soon lived up to its name as local messages of moderate length could be sent for a dime and the company was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends on its capital stock
 in 1879 the same clark wait with h h holley of south dorset formed the american telegraph line extending from manchester depot via factory point and south dorset to dorset
 besides being most convenient the line soon proved a good investment for the owners
 telegraphers at the depot at this time were aaron c burr and mark manley of burr and manley dealers in lumber and dry goods 5
 early equipment was very flimsy; the smallest gusts of wind toppled poles making communications impossible
 but companies continued to spring up
 by 1883 the battenkill telegraph company was in existence and alvin pettibone was its president
 operating in 1887 was the valley telegraph line officers of which were e c orvis president; h k fowler vice-president and secretary; j n hard treasurer; f h walker superintendent; h s walker assistant superintendent
 two companies now had headquarters with clark j wait who by then had his own drugstore at factory point- the northern union telegraph company and the western union
 operators were arthur koop and norman taylor 8
 still existing on a northern union telegraph form is a typical peremptory message from peru grocer j j hapgood to burton and graves' store in manchester- get and send by stage sure four pounds best porterhouse or serloin stake for mrs hapgood send six sweet oranges 5
 about 1888 j e mcnaughton of barnumville and e g bacon became proprietors of the green mountain telegraph company connecting all offices on the western union line and extending over the mountain from barnumville to peru londonderry south londonderry lowell lake windham north windham grafton cambridgeport saxton's river and bellows falls
 from 1896 until 1910 john h whipple was manager of western union at the center in the drugstore he purchased from clark wait 9
 the village office of western union with george towsley as manager and telegrapher continued in hard's drugstore until 1905 5
 during the summers towsley often needed the assistance of a company operator
 these were the years when people flocked to manchester not only to play golf which had come into vogue but also to witness the ekwanok country club tournaments
 new yorkers were kept informed of scores by reporters who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words daily to the metropolitan newspapers
 this boosted local telegraph business and manchester basked in all the free advertising
 in 1914 when the town was chosen for the u s amateur golf tournament a representative hurried here from the boston manager's office
 in his wake came the district traffic supervisor and the cream of the telegraphic profession ten of boston's best chosen for their long experience and thorough knowledge of golf
 during that tournament alone some 250000 words winged their wa y out of manchester
 the old morse system was replaced locally by the simplex modern automatic method in 1929 when ellamae heckman was manager of the western union office
 during summers business was so brisk that mrs wilcox had two assistants and a messenger
 she was succeeded by clarence goyette
 since that time the telegraph office has shifted in location from the railroad station at the depot and shops at the center back to the town clerk's office and drugstore at the village
 after being located for some years in the village at the equinox pharmacy under the supervision of mrs harry mercier it is presently located in the hill and dale shop manchester center 6
 the first known telephone line in manchester was established in july 1883 between burr and manley's store at manchester depot and the kent and root marble company in south dorset
 this was extended the following year to include the railroad station agent's office and thayer's hotel at factory point 6
 in november 1887 a line connecting several dwelling houses in dorset was extended to manchester depot
 telephone wires from louis dufresne's house in east manchester to the dufresne lumber job near bourn pond were up about 1895 5
 eber l taylor of manchester depot recorded the setting of phone poles in east dorset and barnumville in his diary for 1906 6
 these must have been for local calls strictly as in may 1900 the only long distance telephone in town was transferred from c b carleton's to young's shoe store
 a small single switchboard was installed in the village over woodcock's hardware store 
 george woodcock was manager and troubleshooter; elizabeth way was the first operator; and a night operator was also employed 6
 anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones advertised the fact along with the telephone number in the manchester journal
 in 1918 the new england telephone company began erecting a building to house its operations on the corner of u s rte 7 and what is now memorial avenue at manchester center
 service running through barnumville and to bennington county towns east of the mountains was in the hands of the gleason telephone company in 1925 but major supervision of telephone lines in manchester was with the new england telephone and telegraph company which eventually gained all control
 more aerial and underground equipment was installed as well as office improvements to take care of the expanding business 6
 in 1931 mrs f h briggs agent and chief operator who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years' service led agency offices in sales for the year with $2490
 william hitchcock who retired in 1938 was a veteran of thirty-four years' local service
 another veteran telephone operator was edith fleming blackmer who had been in the office forty years at the time of her death in 1960 8
 in 1932 dorset received its own exchange which made business easier for the manchester office but it was not until february 1953 that area service was extended to include manchester and dorset 5
 this eliminated toll calls between the two towns
 within a month calls were up seventy per cent
 power electricity plays such an important part in community life today that it is difficult to envision a time when current was not available for daily use
 yet one has to go back only some sixty years
 the first mention of an electric plant in manchester seems to be one installed in reuben colvin's and houghton's gristmill on the west branch in factory point
 no records are available as to the date or extent of installation but it may have been in 1896
 on june 14 1900 the manchester journal reported that an electrical engineer was installing an electric light plant for edward s isham at ormsby hill
 this was working by the end of august and giving satisfactory service
 in november 1900 surveying was done under john marsden on the east mountains to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water and fall to operate an electric power plant
 nothing came of it perhaps due to lack of opportunity for water storage
 the next step was construction by the manchester light and power company of a plant on the west bank of the battenkill south of union street bridge
 this was nearly completed may 23 1901 with a promise of lights by june 10 but the first light did not go on until september 28 5
 it was at the end of the sidewalk in front of the dellwood cemetery cottage
 the first directors of the manchester light and power company were john marsden m l manley william f orvis george smith and john blackmer
 the officers were john marsden president; john c blackmer vice-president; george smith treasurer; and william f orvis secretary 8
 marsden was manager of the company for ten years and manager of its successor company the colonial light and power company for one year
 at about the time the marsden enterprise was getting under way the vail light and lumber company started construction of a chair stock factory on the site of the present bennington co-operative creamery intending to use its surplus power for generating electricity 6
 manchester then had two competing power companies until 1904 when the manchester light and power company purchased the transmission system of the va il company
 this was fortunate as the vail plant burned in 1905 11
 the colonial light and power company was succeeded by the vermont hydro-electric corporation which in turn was absorbed by the central vermont public service corporation
 the latter now furnishes the area with electricity distributed from a modern sub-station at manchester depot which was put into operation february 19 1930 and was improved in january 1942 by the installation of larger transformers
 for a time following the abandonment of the local plant electric current for manchester was brought in from the south with an emergency tie-in with the vermont marble company system to the north 6
 some who have written on utopia have treated it as a learned diversion of a learned world a phantasy with which more amused himself a holiday work a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits a revel of debate paradox comedy and invention
 with respect to this view two points are worth making 7
 first it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page utopia is described as festivus gay
 it overlooks the other fact that it is described as nec minus salutaris quam festivus no less salutary than gay
 it also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon and quite clearly in more's lexicon the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn 8
 more believed that a man could be both serious and gay 7
 that a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of
 secondly to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in more's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in more himself
 indeed it is even surprising in the canon of christ church and regius professor of ecclesiastical history who fathered this most peculiar view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance english at cambridge who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent
 but to return to the main line of our inquiry 13
 it is doubtful that utopia is still widely read because more was medieval or even because he was a martyr- indeed it is likely that these days many who read utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr
 utopia is still widely read because in a sense more stood on the margin of modernity
 and if he did stand on the margins of modernity it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom
 it was not even in writing latin epigrams sometimes bawdy ones or in translating lucian from greek into latin or in defending the study of greek against the attack of conservative academics or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed erasmus's philological study of the new testament
 similar literary exercises were the common doings of a christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century 8
 had more's writings been wholly limited to such exercises they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works
 more stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone- because he wrote utopia
 and the evidence that he does indeed stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so
 only one other contemporary of more's evokes so immediate and direct a response and only one other contemporary work- niccolo machiavelli and the prince
 can we discover what it is in utopia that has evoked this response? 10
  remember that in seeking the modern in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance there; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval the renaissance and the modern 6
 the medieval was the most important to chambers because he sought to place thomas more the author of utopia in some intelligible relation with st thomas more the martyr
 to others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of christian humanism the renaissance elements are of primary concern 8
 but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has; we want to know what is perennially new about utopia
 what is new about it? 22
  to that question the answer is simple; it can be made in two words utopian communism
 but it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials
 surely there is nothing new about communism 7
 we find it in plato's republic and in utopia more acknowledges his debt to that book
 we find it in that common way of life h pleasing to christ and h still in use among the truest societies of christians that is the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the utopians to christianity
 we find it in the later stoic conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all possessions 10
 this conception was taken up by the early church fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the middle ages; and more was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it
 but although the idea of communism is very old even in more's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 it is not communism as such that we are concerned with
 we are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus: platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist or theological communism; we are concerned with utopian communism- that is simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of utopia as more conceived it
 perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory
 we will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is no t
 in plato's republic communism is- to speak anachronistically- a communism of janissaries
 its function is to separate from the base ruled mass among whom private ownership prevails the governing warrior elite
 moreover it is too readily forgotten that in the republic what gave the initial impetus to plato's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods wives and children was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche; and it is to this problem that the republic ultimately returns
 in more's utopia communism is not a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass
 utopian communism applies to all utopians 11
 and in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central 13
 the concern of utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu the best ordering of a civil society; and it is again and again made clear that utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering
 to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors- in-spirit the monastic communities is with an appropriate shift of adjectives misleading in the same way as to derive it from plato's republic: in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes
 the apostolic community was literally an elite: chosen by christ himself
 and the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors their spiritual athleticism 6
 finally the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by more's time although it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the middle ages
 in that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the fall of man
 it did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned
 the actual function of patristic-civilian-canonist-scholastic communism was adequately set forth by st gregory almost a millenium before more wrote utopia
 the soil is common to all men h
 when we give the necessities of life to the poor we restore to them what is already theirs
 we should think of it more as an act of justice than compassion 13
 because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his 7
 indeed of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian 9
 he is a trustee for the common good however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund wisely or unwisely entrusted to his keeping
 in contrast to this stoic-patristic view utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve
 the utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions 8
 in a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still
 in all the respects just indicated utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role
 neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced
 we do not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus found the tales of the house of atreus among the folk lore of the greeks 6
 in a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it utopian communism remains as an integral whole original- a new thing
 it is not merely a new thing; it is one of the very few new things in utopia; most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism
 but to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern; and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of utopia when martin luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the divine's encounter with man
 new indeed is luther's perception but not modern as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what luther was getting at
 although utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern it is not modern communism or even modern socialism as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice
 consider the features of utopian communism: generous public provision for the infirm; democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests meals taken publicly in common refectories; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens; even houses changed once a decade; six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking; no private property no money; no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term
 whatever the merits of its intent utopian communism is far too naive far too crude to suit any modern socialist or communist 7
 it is not the details of utopian communism that make utopia modern it is the spirit the attitude of mind that informs those details 9
 what that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history the one which reached christianity by the way of stoicism through the church fathers of late antiquity 6
 during the dorr trial the democratic press condemned the proceedings and heralded dorr as a martyr to the principles of the declaration of independence
 during the brown trial however the state's most powerful democratic newspaper the providence daily post stated that brown was a murderer a man of blood and that he and his associates with the assistance of republicans and abolitionists had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow of state and federal governments
 the providence daily journal answered the daily post by stating that the raid of john brown was characteristic of democratic acts of violence and that he was acting in direct opposition to the republican party who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere with slavery in the states
 the two major newspapers in providence continued throughout the crisis to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts and attempting to falsify history
 while the daily post continued to accuse republicans and the daily journal continued to accuse democrats the woonsocket patriot complained that the virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly haste to condemn brown and his men
 editor foss stated of their guilt h there can be no doubt h but they are entitled to sufficient time to prepare for trial and h a fair trial
 the providence daily post thought that there were probably good reasons for the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing gained by a delay would be calmer feelings
 the providence daily journal stated that although the guilt of brown was evident the south must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace
 on october 31 1859 john brown was found guilty of treason against the state of virginia inciting slave rebellion and murder 6
 for these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on friday december 2 1859
 upon receiving the news northern writers editors and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the southern states particularly virginia
 although rhode islanders were preparing for the state elections they watched john brown's trial with extreme interest 7
 on wednesday morning november 2 1859 the providence daily journal stated that although brown justly deserved the extreme penalty no man however criminal ought to suffer the penalty without a fairer trial
 the editor's main criticism of the trial was the haste with which it was conducted
 the readers of the providence daily post however learned that it was generally conceded that old brown had a fair trial 6
 concerning the sentence the editor asked what else can virginia do than to hang the men who have defied her laws organized treason and butchered her citizens
 in the eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction to brown's trial and sentence were basically identical
 j wheaton smith editor of the warren telegraph stated that the ends of justice must be satisfied a solitary example must be set in order that all those misnamed philantropists sic who actuated by a blind zeal dare to instigate riot treason and murder may heed it and shape their future course accordingly
 the editor of the newport advertiser could discover no evidence of extenuating circumstances in the brown trial which would warrant making an exception to the infliction of capital punishment 5
 in direct contrast to the other rhode island editors samuel s foss of the woonsocket patriot outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair
 concerning the sentence foss wrote if it be possible h that mercy shall override vengeance h and that john brown's sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment it would be well- well for the country h and for virginia
 despite the excitement being caused by the trial and sentence of john brown rhode islanders turned their attention to the state elections
 the state had elected republican candidates in the past two years
 there was no doubt as to the control the republican party exercised throughout the state
 if it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state offices by majorities the failure was due to a lingering remnant of the know-nothing party which called itself the american republican party
 the american republicans and the republicans both nominated lieutenant-governor turner for governor
 elisha r potter was the democratic candidate
 the results of the election of 1859 found republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two congressional offices from the eastern and western sections of the state
 during the month of november hardly a day passed when there was not some mention of john brown in the rhode island newspapers 5
 on november 7 1859 the providence daily journal reprinted a letter sent to john brown from e b a quaker lady in newport 7
 in reference to brown's raid she wrote though we are non-resistants and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapons h we know thee was anemated sic by the most generous and philanthropic motives
 e b compared john brown to moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression
 in contrast to e b most rhode islanders hardly thought of john brown as being another moses
 most attempts to develop any sympathy for brown and his actions found an unresponsive audience in rhode island
 on wednesday evening november 23 1859 in warren rev mark trafton of new bedford gave a mission of sympathy lecture in which he favorably viewed the harper's ferry insurrection
 the warren telegraph stated that many of rev trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism and fanaticism 7
 in its account of the trafton lecture the providence daily post said that the remarks of rev trafton made the people indignant 7
 no sympathy or admiration for brown could be found in the providence daily post for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy
 the providence daily journal however stated that brown's courage bravery and heroism in a good cause would make a man a martyr; it gives something of dignity even to a bad one
 the woonsocket patriot admitted that john brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment but he should no more be hung than henry a wise or james buchanan
 the newport mercury exhibited more concern over the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of brown than it did over the development of sympathy for him
 in her letter to john brown e b the quakeress from newport had suggested that the american people owed more honor to john brown for seeking to free the slaves than they did to george washington 7
 during the latter days of november to the day of brown's execution it seems that most rhode islanders did not concur in e b's suggestion
 on november 22 1859 the providence daily journal stated that although brown's pluck and honest fanaticism must be admired any honor paid to brown would only induce other fanatics to imitate his actions
 a week later the daily journal had discovered the initial plans of some providence citizens to hold a meeting honoring john brown on the day of his execution
 the editor of the daily journal warned h that if such a demonstration be made it will not find support or countenance from any of the men whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for providence
 the providence daily post's editor wrote that he could not believe that a meeting honoring brown was to be held in providence 7
 he further called upon the people of providence to rebuke the meeting and avoid disgrace
 on december 2 1859 john brown was hanged at charles town virginia 8
 extraordinary precautions were taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within the enclosure surrounding the scaffold
 in many northern towns and cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled
 such was not the case in rhode island
 the only public demonstration in honor of john brown was held at pratt's hall in providence on the day of his execution
 despite the opposition of the city newspapers the pratt hall meeting brought together a very respectable audience composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years for their radical views upon the subject of slavery of many of our colored citizens and of those who were attracted to the place by the novelty of such a gathering 7
 seated on the platform were amos c barstow ex-mayor of providence and a wealthy republican stove manufacturer; thomas davis an uncompromising garrisonian; the reverend augustus woodbury a unitarian minister; the reverend george t day a free-will baptist; daniel w vaughan and william h h clements
 the latter two were appointed secretaries
 the first speaker was amos c barstow who had been unanimously chosen president of the meeting
 he spoke of his desire to promote the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared john brown of harper's ferry to the john brown of rhode island's colonial period
 barstow concluded that as rhode island's john brown became a canonized hero if not a saint so would it be with john brown of harper's ferry
 the next speaker was george t day
 although admitting brown's guilt on legal grounds day said that brown is no common criminal; his deed was not below but above the law
 following day was woodbury who spoke of his disapproval of brown's attempt at servile insurrection his admiration of brown's character and his opposition to slavery
 woodbury's remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times and once there was hissing
 the fourth and last speaker was thomas davis 14
 by this time large numbers of the audience had left the hall 13
 davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the citizens and all the newspapers of the city
 he said that the propriety or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments
 in the remainder of his speech davis spoke of his admiration for brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they are liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding men whom the laws have condemned
 he recalled that in rhode island a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law of the land and the principles of human liberty 7
 at the close of davis' speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously: whereas john brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights h and is this day doomed to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper: therefore   resolved that while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects yet h in his willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom we still recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit which true men have always admired and which history never fails to honor
 resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in kansas occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on the propagation of slavery in that territory call for a charitable judgment upon his recent efforts in virginia to undermine the despotism from which he had suffered and commend his family to the special sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice
 resolved h that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for resolute action
 resolved that we find in this fearful trage dy at harper's ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible h
 on the morning following the pratt hall meeting the editor of the providence daily journal wrote that although the meeting was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes it could have been avoided completely
 rather than being deceived the eye is puzzled; instead of seeing objects in space it sees nothing more than- a picture 6
 through 1911 and 1912 as the cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to the literal surface became harder and harder to deny the task of keeping the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances
 to reinforce and sometimes to replace the simulated typography braque and picasso began to mix sand and other foreign substances with their paint; the granular texture thus created likewise called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective over much larger areas
 in certain other pictures however braque began to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing
 these areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern stated the literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could be rescued- and set to shuttling again- only by conventional perspective; that is by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography except near the surface
 the accumulation of such devices however soon had the effect of telescoping even while separating surface and depth
 the process of flattening seemed inexorable and it became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion
 it was for this reason and no other that i can see that in september 1912 braque took the radical and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a drawing on paper instead of trying to simulate its texture in paint
 picasso says that he himself had already made his first collage toward the end of 1911 when he glued a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas
 it is true that his first collage looks more analytical than braque's which would confirm the date he assigns it
 but it is also true that braque was the consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography; and moreover he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of analytical cubism as far back as the end of 1910
 when we examine what each master says was his first collage we see that much the same thing happens in each 10
 that braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal by its greater corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness the affixed paper or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures had ever done
 but here again the surface-declaring device both overshoots and falls short of its aim
 for the illusion of depth created by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief which gives way in turn and with equal immediacy to an illusion that seems to contain both- or neither 5
 because of the size of the areas it covers the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness bodily as more than an indication or sign
 literal flatness now tends to assert itself as the main event of the picture and the device boomerangs: the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before
 instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing it the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it and the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with which to finish as well as start his picture
 the actual surface becomes both ground and background and it turns out- suddenly and paradoxically- that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion is in front of upon the surface 5
 in their very first collages braque and picasso draw or paint over and on the affixed paper or cloth so that certain of the principal features of their subjects as depicted seem to thrust out into real bas-relief space- or to be about to do so- while the rest of the subject remains imbedded in or flat upon the surface
 and the surface is driven back in its very surfaceness only by this contrast
 in the upper center of braque's first collage fruit dish a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture plane 7
 the trompe-l'oeil illusion here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses but seems to thrust through the surface of the drawing paper and establish depth on top of it
 yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper and the only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it does not jump
 at the same time the wallpaper strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and patches of shading charcoaled upon them and by their placing in relation to the block capitals; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining
 thus every part and plane of the picture keeps changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane; and it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface 6
 and the same thing more or less can be said of the contents of picasso's first collage
 in later collages of both masters a variety of extraneous materials are used sometimes in the same work and almost always in conjunction with every other eye- deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of
 the area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affixed material- or simply of a painted- in form- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface while something will be drawn painted or even pasted over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth 5
 planes defined as parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially
 all this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it
 flatness may now monopolize everything but it is a flatness become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself- at least an optical if not properly speaking a pictorial illusion 6
 depicted cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal undepicted kind but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind- and it does so moreover without depriving the latter of its literalness; rather it underpins and reinforces that literalness re-creates it
 out of this re-created literalness the cubist subject reemerged
 for it had turned out by a further paradox of cubism that the means to an illusion of depth and plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation or imaging
 in the analytical phase of their cubism braque and picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it; they had also had to generalize it- to the point finally where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as such: as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself 6
 in order to be saved plasticity had had to be isolated; and as the aspect of the subject was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity was isolated under the cubist method the subject itself became largely unrecognizable
 cubism in its 1911-1912 phase was on the verge of abstract art 7
 it was then that picasso and braque were confronted with a unique dilemma: they had to choose between illusion and representation 7
 if they opted for illusion it could only be illusion per se- an illusion of depth and of relief so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation of individual objects
 if on the other hand they opted for representation it had to be representation per se- representation as image pure and simple without connotations of the three-dimensional space in which the objects represented originally existed
 it was the collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation had become for the first time mutually exclusive alternatives
 in the end picasso and braque plumped for the representational and it would seem they did so deliberately
 but the inner formal logic of cubism as it worked itself out through the collage had just as much to do with shaping their decision 8
 when the smaller facet-planes of analytical cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large dense shapes formed by the affixed materials of the collage they had to coalesce- become synthesized- into larger planar shapes themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane
 left in their previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away too abruptly into depth; and the broad opaque shapes of pasted paper would have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane 7
 large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves as independent shapes and to the extent that they are flat they also assert themselves as silhouettes; and independent silhouettes are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject from which a picture starts
 it was because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason- that is because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage as a shape- that the identity of depicted objects or at least parts of them re-emerged in braque's and picasso's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there- but only as flattened silhouettes- than in any of their paintings done wholly in oil before the end of 1913
 analytical cubism came to an end in the collage but not conclusively; nor did synthetic cubism fully begin there 5
 only when the collage had been exhaustively translated into oil and transformed by this translation did cubism become an affair of positive color and flat interlocking silhouettes whose legibility and placement created allusions to if not the illusion of unmistakable three-dimensional identities
 synthetic cubism began with picasso alone late in 1913 or early in 1914; this was the point at which he finally took the lead in cubist innovation away from braque never again to relinquish it 5
 but even before that picasso had glimpsed and entered for a moment a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him 9
 it was as though in that instant he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back- or forward- to literal three-dimensionality
 this he did by using utterly literal means to carry the forward push of the collage literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane
 some time in 1912 picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper and four taut strings thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture plane
 the affixed elements of collage were extruded as it were and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief 7
 and without high density in the core rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained economically let alone built from scratch at today's prices
 however the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever
 the new interchange among the four los angeles freeways including the grade-constructed accesses occupies by itself no less than eighty acres of downtown land one-eighth of a square mile an area about the size of rockefeller center in new york
 it is hard to believe that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law calls the highest and best use of centrally located urban land
 as it affects the city's fiscal situation such an interchange is ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should be taxed to pay for the city services
 subways improved land values without taking away land; freeways boost valuation less and reduce the acreage that can be taxed
 downtown los angeles is already two-thirds freeway interchange street parking lot and garage- one of those preposterous if statistics has already come to pass
 the freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and mitigates the access problem but it also acts inevitably as an artificial isolating boundary
 city planners do not always use this boundary as effectively as they might
 less ambitious freeway plans may be more successful- especially when the roadways and interchanges are raised allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking areas below the ramp 6
 meanwhile the automobile and its friend the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance
 in ever greater numbers factories are locating in the suburbs or in industrial parks removed from the city's political jurisdiction 8
 the appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants enough land area to do the entire job on one floor 5
 to light industry the economies of being on one floor are much slighter but efficiency engineers usually believe in them and manufacturers looking for ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers
 this movement of industry away from the central cities is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe
 it is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern of virtually all american cities
 the big factories which are relatively near the centers of our cities- the rubber factories in akron chrysler's detroit plants ussteel's pittsburgh works- often began on these sites at a time when that was the edge of the city yet close to transport and power 5
 the leapfrog was a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine and the time when the belts of residence surrounding the old factory area were not yet blighted
 the truck and the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his plant site
 until internal combustion became cheap he had to be near a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community of lower-class homes
 the railroad siding is still important- it is usually though not always true that long-haul shipment by rail is cheaper than trucking 5
 but anybody who promises a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these days and many businesses can live without the railroad
 and there are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking lot which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory 5
 willow run general electric's enormous installations at louisville and syracuse the pentagon boeing in seattle douglas and lockheed in los angeles the new automobile assembly plants everywhere- none of these is substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit
 they are all suburban plants relying on the roads to keep them supplied with workers
 and wherever the new thruways go up their banks are lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry
 the drive along massachusetts' route 128 the by-pass which makes an arc about twenty miles from downtown boston may be a vision of the future
 the future could be worse
 the plants along route 128 are mostly well designed and nicely set against the new england rocks and trees
 they can even be rather grand like edward land's monument to the astonishing success of polaroid
 but they deny the values of the city- the crowded competitive tolerant city the melting pot which gave off so many of the most admirable american qualities
 they are segregated businesses combining again on one site the factory and the office drawing their work force from segregated communities
 it is interesting to note how many of the plants on massachusetts' route 128 draw most of their income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements or from the exploitation of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly 7
 while the factories were always the center of the labor market they were often on the city's periphery
 in spreading the factories even farther the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth pattern of the cities 6
 even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's motel has been relatively painless; the hotel-motel demarcation is becoming harder to find every year
 what hurts most is the damage the automobile has done to central-city retailing especially in those cities where public transit is feeble
 some retailing of course always spreads with the population- grocery stores drugstores local haberdasheries and dress shops candy stores and the like
 but whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago- a new bedroom set or a winter coat an easter bonnet a bicycle for junior- the family set off for the downtown department store where the selection would be greatest
 department stores congregated in the one hundred per cent location where all the transit lines converged
 these stores are still there but the volume of the downtown store has been on a relative decline while in many cities the suburban branch sells more and more dry goods
 if the retailer and hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing however his dollar volume continues to rise and it is dollars which you put in the bank
 in most discussions of this phenomenon the figures are substantially inflated
 no suburban shopping-center branch- not even hudson's vast northland outside detroit- does anything like the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise to be found in the home store
 telephone orders distort the picture: the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city number if both are listed in an advertisement especially if the local call eliminates city sales tax
 the suburban branch is thereby credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass doors had never opened 9
 accounting procedures which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branches seem more profitable than they are
 in many cases that statement we break even on our downtown operation and make money on our branches would be turned around if the cost analysis were recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store
 fear of the competition- always a great motivating force in the american economy- makes retailers who do not have suburban operations exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new branches
 the fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are uneconomical that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important as it was downtown and that even highly suburbanized cities will support only so many big branches
 moreover the cost of operations is always high in any new store as the conservative bankers who act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover
 when all has been said however the big branch store remains a major break with history in the development of american retailing 9
 just as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car the trip to the shopping center may seem far easier than to the downtown department store though both are the same distance from home
 indeed there are some cities where the suburban shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown 8
 raymond vernon reports that residents of east st louis have been driving across the mississippi through the heart of downtown st louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping simply because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart of town 5
 to the extent that the problem is merely parking an aggressive downtown management like that of lazarus brothers in columbus ohio can fight back successfully by building a garage on the l ot next door 8
 if the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened away from downtown by traffic problems however the city store can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways or await the completion of the federal highway program
 and if the affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with nice people rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports the downtown department store the central location may be in serious trouble
 today according to land economist homer hoyt shopping centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46000 acres of land which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's central business districts put together
 the downtown store continues to offer the great inducement of variety both within its gates and across the street where other department stores are immediately convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available before making up her mind
 if anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world of retailing it seems likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate children's clothing household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket items
 department stores were built on dry goods especially ladies' fashions and in this area in the long run the suburban branches will be hard put to compete against downtown
 if this analysis is correct the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's cost accountants refuse to acknowledge marginal operations rather than major factors
 historically in america the appeal of cities has been their color and life the variety of experience they offered 7
 how ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm? 9
  was a question that had to be asked long before they saw paree 8
 though americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious belief they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown
 only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference- and we must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians is actually upon us
 in their book american skyline christopher tunnard and henry hope reed argue that franklin roosevelt's new deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility- a fine ironical argument when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote
 the first superhighways- new york's henry hudson and chicago's lake shore san francisco's bay bridge and its approaches a good slice of the pennsylvania turnpike- were built as part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression
 at the same time roosevelt's federal housing administration coupled with henry morgenthau's cheap-money policy permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes 7
 bankers who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house itself got that security from the u s government; householders who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per cent under government aegis
 before losing itself in the sands of the 19th century the grand stream of italian renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance in the brumidi frescos of the capitol rotunda in washington 5
 the artistic generation after brumidi was trained in the paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution and tended to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were easy to find
 but it is a great conception
 the open ceiling wi th allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky: the closed frieze formally divided into historical scenes and tightly tied to the stone walls belong in their large ordering to the line of correggio and his baroque followers 5
 the descent may be remote but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the united states 5
 constantino brumidi designed the decorative scheme as a whole in collaboration with the architect charles u walter at the time when plans were being made to replace the wooden dome of bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure
 after many years and many interruptions he was able to finish the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze beginning with the liberty group opposite the east door and ending with william penn all but one leg when a tragic accident ended his career
 he left at his death sketches drawn to scale for the rest of the circle
 these were carried out not too faithfully by filippo costaggini who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of pennsylvania and noting in pencil in italian that he began at this point
 when costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six feet of empty frieze were left over
 a blank undecorated void plastered in roughcast disfigured the wall of the rotunda until 1951
 then advised by the architect of the capitol the joint committee for the library traditionally responsible for the works of art in the building ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco to show the peace after the civil war the spanish-american war and the birth of aviation to match as nearly as feasible brumidi's technique and composition
 later the cleaning and restoration were ordered first of the older part of the frieze finally of the canopy
 what follows is therefore a description of three separate undertakings the new frescoing of the gap and the successive essays in conservation with some discussion of problems that arose in connection with each
 for the use of students and future restorers a full day- by-day record was kept of all three undertakings complete technical reports on what we found and what we did
 these may be consulted in the office of the architect of the capitol or the library of congress
 the first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coats all in bad condition 6
 it was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree with the older artists' preparation with a mortar one part slaked lime three parts sand to be put on in two layers
 cartoons were drawn full size after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities
 there was some difficulty here
 one had to manage the given subjects three diverse recent events so as to make them part of a classical frieze- that is a pattern of large figures filling the space with not much else against a blank background
 moreover all three representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the length brumidi allowed for each one of his 9
 when it was all arranged to fit and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze the cartoons were tried in place
 the scaffolding a confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above was strong and safe but obscured visibility 7
 nothing could be seen from the floor but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses; and we were able to decide on some amplification of scale
 to be sure of matching color as well as form pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast and large samples painted in fresco then left two months to dry out to their final key
 later it was gratifying to note that they had set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came
 the scaffold was the length of the space to be painted 12
 what bits of brumidi and costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good order though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust
 washed they came out surprisingly clear and bright 9
 it could be seen that both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster one half inch and that both followed the traditional italian fresco technique as described by cennino cennini in the 14th century and current in italy to this day
 that is they used opaque color throughout getting solid highlights with active lime white
 painting a secco is much in evidence
 a brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows and much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat
 this brown is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint
 in our own practice to have the last intonaco plaster coat thick enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in drying we found that it had to be put on in two layers letting the first set awhile before applying the second
 the mortar was three parts sand to two of lime
 some of the lime that is always on hand in the capitol basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us; but to make it stiffer of a really putty-like consistency to avoid crack ing we added a little hydrated lime- hard on the hands but we could see no other disadvantage
 i am told that a mortar longer slaked might have remained longer in condition for painting
 as it was it took the pigment well for six hours enough for our purpose and held it firmly in setting
 it was obvious that to match brumidi white must be mixed with all but the darkest tones
 lime white hard and brilliant has a tendency to jump away from the other colors in drying and also by its capacity to set to preclude the use of ready-made gradations so useful in decorative work 7
 in older italian practice lime dried and reground bianco sangiovanni entered into such prepared shades
 for convenience we chose a stronger pigment unknown to the early italians or to brumidi titanium oxide reserving the active lime white for highest lights put on at the end of the day's stint 7
 other pigments were mostly raw umber some burnt umber and a little yellow ochre
 this last was probably not in brumidi's palette but was needed to take the chill bluish look off the new work next to the old where softening effects of time were seen even after thorough cleaning 6
 the use of secco we tried to restrict to covering joints 10
 experience showed however that it is very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven 8
 later brumidi and costaggini will be seen coping with this same problem
 we were forced as they were to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark areas
 we made it by doerner's recipe five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty; ground together they made a strong adhesive which became waterproof in drying
 figure 1 was taken in 1953
 the new part is finished
 on the right is the brumidi liberty group as it looked after cleaning operations which had not yet come around to the other end; where of costaggini only some foliage has been washed at the point where his work stopped
 one is led to speculate as to why the empty space was there left for our century to finish
 costaggini said it was brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle
 brumidi's son later maintained that costaggini had compressed and mutilated his father's designs ambitiously coveting a bit he could claim for his very own
 this question might be settled by comparing the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions noted presumably in brumidi's hand above the various sections of his long preparatory drawing which has been kept
 whose ever fault it is evident that brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with his histories and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of california gold
 in painting a fresco the handling of wet mortar compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering
 at the very first then brumidi was required by the classically pyramidal shape of his central group to fill in the triangular space above the seated girl on liberty's right before starting on the allegorical figures themselves
 here he put a small man whose missing hands might have left his function doubtful until comparison with the first sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning this was to be the closing figure of the party of forty-niners and was to hold a basket 8
 one sees costaggini's rendering of the same figure more than thirty feet away
 the photograph figure 1 of the completed frieze shows how having been separated from his fellows in useless isolation for eighty years he has now been given a hand and by juxtaposition given a new job to represent the witnesses of the first flight at kitty hawk in 1903
 the startlingly bright effect of the first washings led the committee to order the rest of the brumidi-costaggini cycle cleaned and restored to go with them
 the fixed wooden scaffold was removed and so as to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheels built up from the floor 7
 every few days in the early morning as the work progressed twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the rotunda pavement supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting
 on this giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor after a first dusting we began to wash
 a most useful tool for wetting the surface without running down was made from a greenhouse mist spray nozzle welded to a hose connection to be used at low water pressure
 a valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower 8
 one man sprayed with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting 6
 a second assistant mopped with two sponges
 in parts a repeated sponging was needed but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore the original brightness 6
 no soap or other cleaning agent was used that might bring in unwanted chemical reactions
 the painting a fresco stood up superbly; a little of the secco came off
 necessary retouching was put on at once
 altogether we found the craftsmanship first rate especially brumidi's
 we were greatly helped by there being no traces of former restoring
 apparently not more than dusting had ever been done and not much of that
 the plaster was sound the intonaco firmly attached all over and the pigment solidly incorporated with it in all but a few unimportant places 7
 the greatest source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings above soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime very conspicuous even after cleaning particularly in the landing of columbus oglethorpe and the indians and yorktow n 4
 here the architect referring to the use of the capitol as a public building not a museum requested some repainting to maintain decorative effect rather than leaving blank unsightly patches 8
 these frescos have had no care for eighty years
 with naked gas jets below and leaky windows above enough to ruin wall paintings in any medium they have survived in a building long unheated in winter hot and damp under the iron dome in summer 6
 those whom i wish to address with this letter are for the most part unknown to me
 it may well be that when rudy pozzatti and i visited your country last spring you were living and working close to the places we saw and the streets we walked
 as american artists it was natural that we would want to meet as many soviet artists as possible
 this letter might not have been necessary had our efforts to meet and talk with you been more successful
 even though we did not see many of your faces it appears now quite evident that a considerable number of your profession heard from those whom we had the fortune to encounter that we had been in your mids t 6
 i am very pleased that quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to hear of our reactions and experiences in the ussr
 i can well understand your curiosity
 we ourselves are always eager to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live
 it is my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the good offices of the union of soviet artists
 there should be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter
 pozzatti and i endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes 5
 the time-span of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert on anything i saw
 too much damage is done by experts who have spent even less time if any at all in the ussr
 nevertheless i consider it reasonable because of my commitment as an artist to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific geo-political interests
 if this attitude is seriously questioned in the soviet union it does not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which i live is too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view
 it is a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the plight of a minority such as artists in any social order
 i encountered many questions and great interest upon my return from the soviet union about my reactions to that experience 6
 that which i found most profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction
 almost as if i were talking about something quite unreal 7
 apparently this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen objectively or at least dispassionately to individual impressions of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments
 personal predispositions tend to blunt the ear and in turn the voice as well
 i cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat unusual travelogue
 i am equally impatient with the shrug of the shoulder shake of the head of those who no longer care because they have known it for so long; the aggressive disbelief of those who are romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word revolution; the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical horizons
 difficult as it may have been at times pozzatti and i saw enough talked to enough artists historians and others to realize that the issue is quite clear
 artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends of humanity; they are small in number and their contribution is not immediately decisive in everyday life
 by themselves they may not be able to save the life on this planet but without them there would be very little left worth saving 7
 it cannot be said that our very first day in the soviet union turned out to be an ordinary one
 on that cold but bright april day we were guests of your government in the reviewing stand of red square to witness the poeple's celebration for yuri gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces of the kremlin
 if we thus spent our very first day in the midst of a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement our last day to us at least was equally impressive and very moving even though the crowds were absent and there was almost complete silence
 we stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country just outside of moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of a russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to the point of foregoing the highest international honor
 the grave about half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green the sounds of birds the silence of other graves and the casual paths through small forests
 just yesterday we had met and talked with a living writer a contemporary of the dead poet who is known for his ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously 6
 but today we were aware of only two men
 one had taken a flight into uncharted space in the service of science to return as a living hero
 the other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit
 the flowers on his grave attested to the fact that he as well was somebody's hero
 these two recollections form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which to me at least symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical conflict between materialism and humanism 5
 a struggle that is being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest
 the prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity
 the socialist environment it was stated had cross-fertilized these two extreme seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit
 when i speculated on one such occasion that the new growth like other mutations might be unable to propagate i was immediately accused of preaching racial prejudice
 i could not bring myself to answer that some of my best friends are non-propagating mules
 this kind of reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to
 after a while we were perhaps less surprised but still puzzled when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and illogical comparison s
 a chance remark about lenin's sealed train brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to george washington's cherry tree 6
 theories of the behavior pattern of population masses were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern of gaseous masses
 no wonder that pozzatti and i had at times difficulty in remembering the real purpose of our presence namely cultural exchange 5
 typical of such an experience was the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the union of soviet artists
 we had looked forward to what we hoped to be our first informal meeting with a number of moscow's artists
 instead we became involved in a series of friendly but overly formal welcoming addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind
 the terms of friendship understanding cooperation etc tend to become somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use 6
 i can only hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion
 the presiding female functionary of massive proportions and forbidding appearance initially did not contribute to the expressions of friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing the arts
 it was only after we had responded with what i fear were similar cliches that she went into action by questioning our desire for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and warlike actions by the us government in cuba and laos 7
 she retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might well terminate right then and there
 unfortunately she returned later just as i had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the cultural exchange program would be the re-emergence of abstract art in russia with social realism regaining dominance in the us
 this gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should not presume to lecture her on abstraction
 she did not go so far as to say as was done on other occasions that abstraction as well as impressionism were a russian invention that had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the ussr pozatti and i could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere
 we were to discover in fact that quite a number of people share with us the impression that in contrast to other soviet regions moscow's atmosphere is depressingly subdued and official
 to have one's intentions deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste of time
 until our moscow experience i had not considered it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally
 artists simply do not talk to each other in that fashion; and furthermore i could not presume the implication that i spoke for american artists as a group
 to save time some clarification seemed necessary
 the following is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists in leningrad:   we have come to your land with the express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your ways
 our presence here should also be considered further sincere evidence of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek any and all possible ways to effect closer peaceful ties among all people
 we are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between individuals
 in spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experienced among you we have already seen many indications of your character and spirit
 we are acutely aware that yours is a society which in spite of several wars and many privations has developed itself into one of the foremost nations of the world
 your past history is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect
 your present history is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements
 we have come to you to experience something of your way of life while also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours 8
 while we as american artists believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as well as the international community as a whole 6
 in stating this position we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect
 as a matter of fact we prize the diversity among our own people so much that we will not presume to speak for all other american artists
 but certainly all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge and search for similarities between you and us but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding
 like yourselves we have pride and love for our country 9
 to many of us this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian terror in order to live in dignified freedom 8
 as artists we feel the same obligation as do other individuals in considering ourselves responsible citizens of a great nation 8
 the sane society is an ambitious work
 its scope is as broad as the question: what does it mean to live in modern society? 9
  a work so broad even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed by a moral vision must necessarily fail 5
 even a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spots errors of fact and argument important exclusions areas of ignorance and prejudice undue emphases on trivia examples of broad positions supported by flimsy evidence and the like
 such books are easy prey for critics
 nor need the critic be captious
 a careful and orderly man who values precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be put off by such a book
 it is a simple matter for one so disposed to take a work like the sane society and shred it into odds and ends
 the thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large and vigorous family- a motley jumble of discarded objects some outworn and some that were never useful some once whole and bright but now chipped and tarnished some odd pieces whose history no one remembers here and there a gem everything fascinating because it suggests some part of the human condition- the whole adding up to nothing more than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users
 that could be easily done but there is little reason in it 14
 it would come down to saying that fromm paints with a broad brush and that after all is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he has from the outset
 i mention these features of the book because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must be mentioned
 it would be superfluous to build a critique around them 15
 there are more substantial criticisms to be made of fromm's account of capitalist civilization
 it is worthwhile to recall that fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects
 since i have already discussed his moral position that discussion is incorporated by reference into the following pages which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of fromm's treatment 5
 i shall first indicate a couple of weaknesses in fromm's analysis then argue that granted these weaknesses he still has much left that is valuable and finally raise the general question of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to the question of alienation
 almost no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation
 despite its rather long intellectual history alienation is still a promising hypothesis and not a verified theory
 the idea has received much attention in philosophy in literature and in a few works of general social criticism such as the sane society
 what is missing is work that would answer presumably by the use of survey methods and guttman-type attitude scales such questions as these: what are the components of the feeling-state described as alienation? 6
  how widespread is alienation? 18
  what is its incidence among the various classes and subgroups of the population? 8
  taking alienation as a dependent variable with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated? 7
  considered as an independent variable how does it affect behavior in various sectors of life? 5
  until such work is done there must remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of the intellectual who rejected by and in turn rejecting the larger society projects his own fear and despair onto the broader social screen
 i am not suggesting that fromm ought to do this kind of work 11
 nor do i think that alienation is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual
 i am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence comes in any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain important limitations
 until such evidence appears we must make do with the evidence we have
 here perhaps fromm is vulnerable for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather special ways
 fromm's analysis of alienation in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the bureaucratization of the corporation the separation of ownership from control and the broad dispersion of stock ownership
 for all these points he relies exclusively on berle and means's study of 1932 the modern corporation and private property 6
 the broad conclusions of that pioneering work remain undisturbed but subsequent research has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support has suggested important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference and has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area
 fromm seems unaware of these developments
 another example is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topics: he cites such survey-type findings just three times
 moreover the conclusions he draws from the findings are not always the only ones possible
 for example he cites the following data from two studies on job satisfaction: in the first study 85 per cent of professionals and executives 64 per cent of white collar people and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with their jobs; in the second study the percentages were 86 for professionals 74 for managerial persons 42 for commercial employees 56 for skilled workers and 48 for semi-skilled workers
 he concludes that these data show a remarkably high percentage of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers
 starting from other value premises than fromm's some analysts might conclude that the percentages really tell us very little at all while others might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low 5
 eric hoffer for example once said that america was a paradise- the only one in the history of the world- for workingmen and small children
 what matters is that while fromm's reading of the data is not the only one possible it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfied
 fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction conducted by the opinion research corporation in 1945 in which 49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as he could in a day's work while 41 per cent said he should not do his best but should turn out only the average amount 4
 fromm says these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread
 that is one way to read the findings but again there are other ways
 one might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary associations in the factory an interpretation which would run counter to fromm's theory of alienation
 or he might remind fromm that the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low: after all the medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount; and today's trade unions announce pretty much the same view
 in view of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of survey-type findings on public opinion and considering the criticisms which can be brought against fromm's philosophical anthropology such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously
 are people happy are they as satisfied unconsciously as they believe themselves to be? 7
  considering the nature of man and the conditions for happiness this can hardly be so
 the ambiguities suggested above stem from a more basic difficulty in fromm's style of thought
 he seems to use the term alienation in two different ways 13
 sometimes he uses it as a subjective descriptive term and sometimes as an objective diagnostic one
 that is sometimes it is used to describe felt human misery and other times it is postulated to explain unfelt anxiety and discontent
 the failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader
 it also permits fromm to do some dubious things with empirical findings
 when alienation is used as an objective and diagnostic category for example it becomes clear that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far toward conquering it
 starting from this and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society it would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread stated worker satisfaction rather than widespread stated worker dissatisfaction
 the point is that in a system such as fromm's which recognizes unconscious motivations and which rests on certain ethical absolutes empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition the writer is urging at the moment
 thus in the example cited above fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being deprived unconsciously unknowingly of fulfillment and then supports this with survey data reporting conscious experienced frustrations
 he has his cake and eats it too: if the workers say they are dissatisfied this shows conscious alienation; if they say they are satisfied this shows unconscious alienation
 this sort of manipulation is especially troublesome in fromm's work because although his system is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions he asserts that it is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and from his own consulting room
 while the empirical psychoanalytic label which fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying philosophy it does increase the marketability of his product
 the final example of the failure to use available evidence though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far bee n considered comes from fromm's treatment of some other writers who have dealt with the same themes
 in a brief chapter dealing with various other diagnoses he quotes isolated passages from some writers whose views seem to corroborate his own and finds it most remarkable that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth h
 he finds it equally remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of the twentieth century
 there is nothing remarkable about this at all 20
 it is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes
 there is a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm's citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category 11
 glance at the list: burckhardt tolstoy proudhon thoreau london marx tawney mayo durkheim tannenbaum mumford a r heron huxley schweitzer and einstein
 this is a delightfully motley collection
 one can make them say the same thing only by not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants to hear 8
 the method of selection fromm uses achieves exactly that 10
 furthermore the list is interesting for its omissions 9
 it omits for example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english social critics nearly all the great writers whose basic position is religious and all those who are with more or less accuracy called existentialists
 of course the list also excludes all writers who are fairly optimistic about the modern situation; these almost by definition are spokesmen for an alienated ideology
 it is not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm finds so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion 7
 turning from these problems of the use of evidence one meets another type of difficulty in fromm's analysis which is his loose and ambiguous use of certain important terms
 one such instance has already been presented: his use of alienation
 the only other one i shall mention here is his use of the term capitalism
 for fromm capitalism is the enemy the root of all evil 7
 it is of course useful to have a sovereign cause in one's social criticism for it makes diagnosis and prescription much easier than they might otherwise be
 if one characteristic distinguishes boris godunov it is the consistency with which every person on the stage- including the chorus- comes alive in the music
 much of this lifelike quality results from mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech inflections
 in this he followed a path that led back to the very source of opera; such composers as monteverdi lully and purcell with the same goal in mind had developed styles of recitative sensitively attuned to their own languages
 through long experimentation in his songs mussorgsky developed a russian recitative as different from others as the language itself 7
 giving most of his musical continuity to the orchestra he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words
 the moments of sung melody in the usual sense come most often when the character is actually supposed to be singing as in folk songs and liturgical chants
 otherwise mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies for prolonged expressions of emotion- boris' first monologue for example 6
 even then the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that the word comes first in importance
 aside from boris himself one need but examine the secondary roles to place mussorgsky among the masters of musical portraiture 6
 even those who appear in only one or two scenes are full personalities defined with economical precision
 consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action: pimen varlaam missail and the jesuit rangoni
 under no circumstances could we mistake one for the other; each musical setting has an individual touch
 pimen is an old man weak in body- his voice rarely rises to a full forte- but firm and clear of mind
 his calmness offers contrast to grigori's youthful excitement 9
 a quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appears whenever the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past life:    this theme comes to represent the outer world the realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance quite distinct from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery
 it changes and develops according to the text; it introduces pimen when he comes before boris in the last act
 once he has been identified however a new melody is used to accompany his narrative a bleak motif with barren octaves creating a rather ancient effect:    an imaginative storyteller pimen takes on the character he describes as if he were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure
 here the composer uses a favorite device of his the intensification of the mood through key relationships
 the original d minor seems to symbolize blindness inescapable in spite of all attempts to move away from it
 as the child addresses the shepherd in a dream light- in the form of the major mode- begins to appear and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shining d major
 varlaam and missail always appear together and often sing together in a straightforward rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from the more subtle and well-educated pimen 4
 their begging song might easily be a folk melody:    the same could be said for the song to which they make their entrance in the final scene
 apparently their origin is humble their approach to life direct and unsophisticated
 whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb them now
 missail is the straight man not very talkative mild-mannered when he does speak
 varlaam is loud rowdy uninhibited in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same
 a rough ostinato figure heard first in the introduction to the inn scene characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into the action:    the song of kazan in which this figure becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment fills in the picture of undisciplined high spirits
 the phrasing is irregular and the abrupt key changes have a primitive forcefulness
 varlaam's music begins to ramble as he feels the effects of the wine but he pulls himself together when the need arises 5
 both monks respond to the guard's challenge with a few phrases of their begging song; a clever naturalistic touch is varlaam's labored reading of the warrant
 as the knack gradually comes back to him his rhythm becomes steadier with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader
 for the only time in the opera words are not set according to their natural inflection; to do so would have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene
 musically and dramatically rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as varlaam
 his music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with dappertutto in offenbach's hoffman
 his speech shows none of the native accent of the russian characters; in spite of the italian name he sounds french 7
 his personality appears more striking by contrast with marina who is- perhaps purposely- rather superficially characterized 7
 rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it 5
 the effect is as if he had materialized out of nowhere 11
 he speaks quietly concealing his authority beneath a smooth humility just as the shifting harmonies that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them
 he addresses marina with great deference calling her princess at first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme that he uses her given name placing himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father
 curiously this scene is a close parallel to one that verdi was writing at the same time the scene between amonasro and aida 7
 rangoni and amonasro have the same purpose- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her country's cause- and their tactics are much the same
 rangoni begins by describing the sad state of the church; this brings a reaction of distress from marina
 the music becomes ethereal as he calls up a vision of her own sainthood: it is she he tells her who can bring the truth to russia and convert the heretics
 as if in a trance she repeats his words- then realizes with a shock her own audacity
 this is no assignment for a frivolous girl she assures him 13
 now rangoni comes to the point and we hear for the first time a long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of his sinister power
 it is a phrase as arresting as a magician's gesture with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness
 another theme sinuously chromatic appears as he directs her to gain power over grigori by any means even at the cost of her honor 6
 coming from a priest the music sounds as odd as the advice: marina rebels at this suggestion
 her pride is as much at stake as her virtue; she is the unattainable beauty the princess who turns away suitors by the dozen 5
 indignantly she denounces rangoni for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her
 at once the jesuit pulls out all the stops 12
 to music of a menacing darkness he describes the powers of satan gaining control of the girl poisoning her soul with pride and destroying her beauty
 the combined threat of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her and she falls terrified at his feet
 with another sudden change of mood he is again calm and protective exhorting her to trust and obey him as god's spokesman- and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction
 whatever the source of rangoni's power marina is his captive now; we are reminded of this at the end of the next scene when his theme cuts through the warmth of the love duet again throwing a chill over the atmosphere
 the most unusual feature of boris however is the use of the greatest character of all the chorus
 this is the real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not boris versus grigori or shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child but boris versus the russian people
 mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the extent to which choral scenes propel the action
 boris' first entrance seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the coronation scene with its dazzling confusion of tonalities 5
 we have a brief glimpse of the tsar's public personality the official boris but our real focus is on the excitement of the crowd- a signigicant contrast with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene its bitter resentment and fury in the final act
 one reason for the unique vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression
 it rarely speaks as a unit
 even in its most conventional appearance the guests' song of praise to marina there are a few female dissenters criticizing the princess for her coldness
 in many passages- for example the council of boyars- each section of the chorus becomes a character group with a particular opinion
 hot arguments arise between tenors and basses who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea
 the opening scene shows this method at its most individual 10
 mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people those who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without understanding the causes
 they are held in control by force but barely 13
 they will kneel and plead for boris' leadership in a strangely intense song its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath but when the police with their cudgels move away they mock and grumble and fight among themselves
 there is a quick change from the plaintive song to a conversational tone
 hey mityukh asks one group what are we shouting about? 6
  and mityukh apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd replies that he has no notion
 the jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before ending it with a wail of despair
 mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical music with considerable dramatic force
 in pimen's cell the soft prayers of the monks heard from offstage not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young grigori's thoughts and his situation
 this is especially striking between pimen's quiet exit and grigori's vehement outburst against boris
 again as boris feels himself nearing death a procession files into the hall singing a hymn its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere:  the words are hardly calculated to put the tsar's mind at ease
 they echo the words with which he has described his own vision of the dying child who trembles and begs for mercy- and there is no mercy
 the living as well as the dead now accuse him; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal one
 one of the outstanding assets of the present production is the restoration of the st basil's scene usually omitted from performances and rarely included in a published score
 though brief it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy 7
 in addition it is an important link in the plot giving us a revealing glimpse of the people's attitude toward boris and the false dimitri
 the mayhem in the forest of kromy is a natural sequel 8
 the st basil's scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the square the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny 0
 in the orchestra we hear first a hushed hesitant pizzicato figure then the insistent police motif as it appeared in the opening scene
 the service is over and a number of people come from the church with their spokesman mityukh in the lead
 they bring the news that the pretender has been excommunicated; this is met with scorn by the hearers who claim that mityukh is lying or drunk
 contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment solemn there is still more news mityukh announces: they have prayed for the soul of the tsarevich
 so far these remarks like most criticisms of hardy have tacitly assumed that his poetry is all of a piece one solid mass of verse expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development 5
 for critics hardy has had no poetic periods- one does not speak of early hardy or late hardy or of the london or max gate period but simply of hardy as of a poetic monolith
 this seems odd when one recalls that he wrote poetry longer than any other major english poet: domicilium is dated between 1857 and 1860; seeing the moon rise is dated august 1927
 one might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd years some changes in style and method would have occurred some development taken place
 this is not however the case and development is a term which we can apply to hardy only in a very limited sense
 in a time when poetic style and poetic belief as well seem in a state of continual flux hardy stands out as a poet of almost perverse consistenc y
 though he struggled with philosophy all his life he never got much beyond the pessimism of his twenties; the sober opinion of his letter to noyes written when hardy was eighty years old is essentially that of his first philosophical notebook entry made when he was twenty-five: the world does not despise us: it only neglects us 
 and though in his later years he revised his poems many times the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style which he had established before he was thirty; so that while it usually is easy to recognize a poem by hardy it is difficult to date one 6
 there is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about hardy's development: he did develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his
 there is only one hardy style but in the earlier poems that style is only intermittently evident and when it is not the style is the style of another poet or of the fashion of the time 12
 in the later poems however the personal tone predominates 12
 the bad early poems are bad shakespeare or bad swinburne; the bad late poems are bad hardy
 there are two ways of getting at a poet's development: through his dated poems and through the revisions which he made in later editions of his work
 about a quarter of hardy's poems carry an appended date line usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive years or two separate dates when hardy worked on the poem or an approximate date 
 these dates are virtually the only clues we have to the chronology of the poems since the separate volumes are neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other 5
 with the exception of satires of circumstance each volume contains dated poems ranging over several decades ; the internal organization rarely has any chronological order except in obvious groups like the poems of pilgrimage the poems of 1912-13 and the war poems
 from the dated poems we can venture certain conclusions about hardy's career in poetry always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative
 the dated poems suggest that while hardy's concern with poetry may have been constant his production was not
 he had two productive periods one in the late 1860's the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920 latter period and these alone total about one-tenth of all hardy's 
 there was one sterile period: only one poem is dated between 1872 and 1882 and except for the poems written on the trip to italy in 1887 very few from 1882 to 1890
 the dated poems also give us an idea of the degree to which hardy drew upon past productions for his various volumes and therefore probably are an indication of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time
 poems of the past and the present and time's laughingstocks both published while hardy was at work on the dynasts draw heavily on poems written before 1900
 satires of circumstance and moments of vision coming during his most productive decade are relatively self-contained; the former contains no poem dated before 1909- 10- that is no poem from a period covered by a previous volume- and the latter has only a few such 4
 the last three volumes are again more dependent on the past as hardy's creative powers declined in his old age
 these observations about hardy's productivity tally with the details of his life as we know the m
 the first productive period came when he was considering poetry as a vocation before he had decided to write fiction for a living he wrote that he wrote verses 1865-1868; gave up verse for prose  7
 during the poetically sterile years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was in addition burdened with bad health 
 two entries in the early life support the assumption that during this period hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry
 mrs hardy records that h at the end of november 1881 he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible ; and on christmas day 1890 hardy wrote: while thinking of resuming 'the viewless wings of poesy' before dawn this morning new horizons seemed to open and worrying pettinesses to disappear
 there are more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's- hardy had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume of his fiction- but none in 1891 the year of tess and only one in 1895 the year of jude
 after 1895 the number increases and in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no dated poem- 1903 when hardy was at work on the dynasts
 the second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can be related to three events: the completion of the dynasts in 1909 which left hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years; the death of emma hardy in 1912 which had a profound emotional effect on hardy for which he found release in poetry; and the first world war 7
 it may seem strange that a poet should come to full fruition in his seventies but we have it on hardy's own authority that h he was a child till he was sixteen a youth till he was five-and-twenty and a young man till he was nearly fifty life 
 we may carry this sequence one step further and say that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers wanting only the impetus of two tragedies one personal the other national to loose those powers in poetry
 hardy's two productive decades were separated by forty years yet between them he developed only in that he became more steadily himself- it was a narrowing not an expanding process
 like a wise gardener hardy pruned away the shakespearian sonnets and songs and the elements of meter and poetic diction to which his personal style was not suited and let the main stock of his talent flourish
 the range of the later poetry is considerably narrower but the number of successful poems is far greater
 we can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look at two poems of very different qualities: revulsion and neutral tones
 there is not much to be said for revulsion
 like about half of the 1860-70 poems it is a sonnet on a conventional theme- the unhappiness of love
 almost anyone could have written it; it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form but it is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike hardy
 the language is the conventional language of the form; there is no phrase or image that sounds like hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality to the poem
 it is smoother than hardy usually is but with the smoothness of anonymity
 it is obviously a young man's poem written out of books and not out of experience; it asserts emotion without evoking it- that is to say it is sentimental
 there are many such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems
 neutral tones we immediately recognize as a fine poem in hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite colloquial language the hard particular colorless images the slightly odd stanza-form the dramatic handling of the occasion the refusal to resolve the issue- all these we have seen in hardy's best poems 5
 the poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic sources of diction yet it is obviously not ordinary speech- only hardy would say a grin of bitterness swept therebylike an ominous bird a-wing or wrings with wrong or would describe a winter sun as god-curst
 the details of the setting of neutral tones are not strictly speaking metaphorical but they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love and in this way love and weather the emotions and the elements symbolize each other in a way that is common to many of hardy's best poems and to some moving passages in the novels as well 
 neutral tones is an excellent example of hardy's mature style drawn from his earliest productive period; i cite it as evidence that he did not develop through new styles as he grew older but that he simply learned to use better what he already had
 in the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world; if it is somber it is also precise and the precision lends authority to the vision
 in revulsion on the other hand the pessimism is a case not proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's right to speak as he does
 in the 1860-70 decade there are many poems like revulsion but there is only one neutral tones
 hardy was not hardy very often
 the poems of 1912- 13 offer a good example of hardy's style as it was manifested in the later productive decade
 these are the poems hardy wrote after the death of his first wife; they compose a painful elegy to what might have been to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness and ended in long years of suffering and hatred
 hardy obviously felt that these poems were peculiarly personal and private; he sometimes called them an expiation and he would not allow them to be published in periodicals
 they are the only poems that he rearranged as a group between their first appearance and the publication of the collected poems 6
 the elegiac tone is hardy's natural tone of voice and it is not surprising that the 1912-13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his
 the view is always toward the past; but the mood is not quite nostalgic- hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable pastness of the past and the eternal deadness of the dead
 the poems are the epigraph tells us the traces of an ancient flame; the fire of love is dead and hardy stands as the speaker does in the last poem of the sequence over the burnt circle of charred sticks and thinks of past happiness and present grief honest and uncomforted
 critically invisible modern revolt like x-rays and radioactivity is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels where it is called delinquency
 disaffiliation by the way is the term used by the critic and poet lawrence lipton who has written several articles on this subject the first of which in the nation quoted as epigraph we disaffiliate h- john l lewis
 like the pillars of hercules like two ruined titans guarding the entrance to one of dante's circles stand two great dead juvenile delinquents- the heroes of the post-war generation: the great saxophonist charlie parker and dylan thomas
 if the word deliberate means anything both of them certainly deliberately destroyed themselves
 both of them were overcome by the horror of the world in which they found themselves because at last they could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art
 both of them were my friends
 living in san francisco i saw them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted by exasperation or fatigue 7
 so as the years passed i saw them each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration
 the last time i saw bird at jimbo's bob city he was so gone- so blind to the world- that he literally sat down on me before he realized i was there
 what happened man? 23
  i said referring to the pretentious jazz concert 9
 evil man evil he said and that's all he said for the rest of the night
 about dawn he got up to blow
 the rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent melody spiraled through it
 the last time i saw dylan his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality
 it had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter 8
 being with him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones
 now dylan thomas and charlie parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end
 as artists they were very similar
 they were both very fluent
 but this fluent enchanting utterance had compared with important artists of the past relatively little content
 neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture at his own creativity
 the principal theme of thomas's poetry was the ambivalence of birth and death- the pain of blood-stained creation
 music of course is not so explicit an art but anybody who knew charlie parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own gift
 both of them did communicate one central theme: against the ruin of the world there is only one defense- the creative act 9
 this of course is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry 9
 it is the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance to parker or thomas
 the difference is that horace accepted his theme with a kind of silken assurance
 to dylan and bird it was an agony and terror
 i do not believe that this is due to anything especially frightful about their relationship to their own creativity 16
 i believe rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seemed to be the sole value
 horace's column of imperishable verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of augustan rome
 art may have been for him the most enduring orderly and noble activity of man
 but the other activities of his life partook of these values 13
 they did not actively negate them
 dylan thomas's verse had to find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning jews
 he was able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air raids and gas ovens
 as the world began to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven i believe his art became meaningless to him
 i think all this could apply to parker just as well although because of the nature of music it is not demonstrable- at least not conclusively
 thomas and parker have more in common than theme attitude life pattern
 in the practice of their art there is an obvious technical resemblance
 contrary to popular belief they were not great technical innovators
 their effects are only superficially startling
 thomas is a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writers like pierre reverdy or apollinaire 7
 similarly the innovations of bop and of parker particularly have been vastly overrated by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado 4
 the tonal novelties consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music for centuries
 and there is less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz no matter how progressive and dixieland than there is between two movements of many conventional symphonies
 what parker and his contemporaries- gillespie davis monk roach etc- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation of the older jazz into the basic structure of which it then became an integral part and with which it then developed
 this is true of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages of almost anybody- benny carter johnny hodges 7
 it is true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously or at least is continuously sprung so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or strophe
 this is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque to rococo music
 it is the difference between bach and mozart 25
 it is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what thomas did to poetry
 the special syntactical effects of a rimbaud or an edith sitwell- actually ornaments- become the main concern 7
 the metaphysical conceits which fascinate the reactionary generation sti ll dominant in backwater american colleges were embroideries
 thomas's ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves 9
 the immediate theme if it exists is incidental and his main theme- the terror of birth- is simply reiterated
 this is one difference between bird and dylan which should be pointed out
 again contrary to popular belief there is nothing crazy or frantic about parker either musically or emotionally
 his sinuous melody is a sort of nai^ve transcendence of all experience
 emotionally it does not resemble berlioz or wagner; it resembles mozart
 this is true also of a painter like jackson pollock 16
 he may have been eccentric in his behavior but his paintings are as impassive as persian tiles
 partly this difference is due to the nature of verbal communication 11
 the insistent talk-aboutiveness of the general environment obtrudes into even the most idyllic poetry
 it is much more a personal difference
 thomas certainly wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world
 parker and pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world
 technique pure and simple rendition is not of major importance but it is interesting that parker following lester young was one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution
 in modern jazz the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional embouchure
 metrically thomas's verse was extremely conventional as wa s incidentally the verse of that other tragic enrage hart crane 5
 i want to make clear what i consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war arts
 ornament is confabulation in the interstices of structure 7
 a poem by dylan thomas a saxophone solo by charles parker a painting by jackson pollock- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves
 confabulation has come to determine structure
 uninhibited lyricism should be distinguished from its exact opposite- the sterile extraneous invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals or present blight of poetic professors
 just as hart crane had little influence on anyone except very reactionary writers- like allen tate for instance to whom valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities of an apollinaire let alone a paul eluard were nonsense- so dylan thomas's influence has been slight indeed
 in fact his only disciple- the only person to imitate his style- was w s graham who seems to have imitated him without much understanding and who has since moved on to other methods 7
 thomas's principal influence lay in the communication of an attitude- that of the now extinct british romantic school of the new apocalypse- henry treece j f hendry and others- all of whom were quite conventional poets
 parker certainly had much more of an influence 11
 at one time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in america to blow like bird 6
 even before his death this influence had begun to ebb 14
 in fact the whole generation of the founding fathers of bop- gillespie monk davis blakey and the rest- are just now at a considerable discount
 the main line of development today goes back to lester young and by-passes them
 the point is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays are aberrant idiosyncratic
 there is no longer any sense of continuing development of the sort that can be traced from baudelaire to eluard or for that matter from hawthorne through henry james to gertrude stein 12
 the cubist generation before world war 1 and on a lower level the surrealists of the period between the wars both assumed an accepted universe of discourse in which to quote andre breton it was possible to make definite advances exactly as in the sciences
 i doubt if anyone holds such ideas today
 continuity exits but like the neo-swing music developed from lester young it is a continuity sustained by popular demand
 in the plastic arts a very similar situation exists 14
 surrealists like hans arp and max ernst might talk of creation by hazard- of composing pictures by walking on them with painted soles or by tossing bits of paper up in the air
 but it is obvious that they were self-deluded
 nothing looks anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst or arp
 nothing looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion
 many of the post-world war 2 abstract expressionists apostles of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard look alike and do lo ok like accidents
 the aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random may exist but it is a very impoverished appeal
 once again what has happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals the accidents of painting
 it is curious that at its best the work of this school of painting- mark rothko jackson pollock clyfford still robert motherwell willem de-kooning and the rest- resembles nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters: the mother- of-pearl shimmer in the background of a henry mcfee itself a formula derived from renoir; the splashes of light and black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of hals and sargent
 often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the pure utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values
 you have only to compare such painting with the work of say sesshu to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly
 at its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo decorative surface
 its poverty shows up immediately when compared with tiepolo where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity and power
 a tiepolo painting however confabulated is a universe of tensions in vast depths
 a pollock is an object of art- bijouterie- disguised only by its great size
 in fact once the size is big enough to cover a whole wall it turns into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper
 now there is nothing wrong with complicated wallpaper 19
 there is just more to tiepolo
 the great ashikaga brush painters painted wallpapers too- at least portable ones screens
 a process of elimination which leaves the artist with nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest in either artist or public for very long
 so in the last couple of years abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion- indications of landscape or living figures 10
 anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasions a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age 5
 hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at finnsburg and improvises the tale of beowulf's exploits in a complimentary comparison of the geatish visitor with sigemund ; alcinou^s' court bard sings of the discovered adultery of ares and aphrodite and takes up a tale of odysseus while the ithacan wanderer listens on  5
 nothing in all this is autobiographical: unlike the poets of deor and widsith the poet of beowulf is not concerned with his own identity; the poet of the odyssey reputed blind reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel demodocus
 since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there is prima-facie evidence that beowulf and the homeric poems each derive from an oral tradition
 that such a tradition lies behind the iliad and the odyssey at least is hard to deny
 milman parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant homeric poems are largely formulaic and was led to postulate that they could be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of greek epic survived; he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate oral composition and assumed the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas 5
 proceeding from parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata francis p magoun jr argues that beowulf likewise was created from a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive generations and the thesis is striking and compelling 4
 yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment: beowulf and the homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent 9
 the bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a very skilful oral poet but it appears safe to assume that no sustained narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty even in a language of many terminal inflections 5
 assonance seems nearly as severe a curb although in a celebrated passage william of malmesbury declares that a song of roland was intoned before the battle commenced at hastings
 the anglo-saxon alliterative line and the homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint; the verse of beowulf or of the iliad and the odyssey was not easy to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents perforce in earning a livelihood
 yet certain aids were valuable and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without a pause
 the poet in a written tradition who generally never blots a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame 5
 but the oral poet cannot pause; he must improvise continuously with no apparent effort
 even though the bondage of his verse is not so great as the writing poet can manage it is still great enough for him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid composition 5
 the germanic poet had such aids in the kennings which provided for the difficulties of alliteration; the homeric poet had epithets which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter
 either poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines because the kennings and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns 4
 other synonyms could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease i shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest poss1ble sense and name for example gar-dene a kenning for the danes
 verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents and to designate the members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic language
 limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in anglo-saxon as in the other germanic dialects we cannot say how frequently the kennings in beowulf recurred in contemporary epic on the same soil
 but we can say that since a writing poet with leisure before him would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and substantial circumlocution the kennings like the epithets must reasonably be ascribed to an oral tradition
 one of the greatest homerists of our time frederick m combellack argues that when it is assumed the iliad and the odyssey are oral poems the postulated single redactor called homer cannot be either credited with or denied originality in choice of phrasing
 any example of grand or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his completely unknown fellow-craftsmen 6
 the quest of the historical homer is likely never to have further success; no individual word in the iliad or the odyssey can be credited to any one man; no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before christ
 this observation is of interest not only to students of homeric poetry but to students of anglo-saxon poetry as well 6
 to the extent that a tale is twice told its final author must be suspect although plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi
 combellack argues further and here he makes his main point that once the iliad and the odyssey are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to formulaic poetry homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they previously found arable 4
 with a few important and a few more unimportant exceptions no expression can be deemed le mot juste for its context because each was very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow
 words or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable time-servers sometimes accurate and sometimes not 4
 this observation too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry 10
 to the extent that a language is formulaic its individual components must be regarded as no more distinguished than other cliches 6
 w f bryan suggests that certain kennings in beowulf were selected sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness but such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language of beowulf is formulaic
 if the master of scops who was most responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional he was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd and sophisticated misuse of speech elements
 once many significant phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity they are not to be defended for their semantic properties in isolated contexts 8
 it is false to be certain of having discovered in the language of beowulf such effects as intentional irony
 yet if the argument is turned awry there may be found a great deal in bryan's view after all
 a formulaic element need not be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious reflection 6
 time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous
 a long evolution in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate
 true we do not know how they were regarded in their day but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who have read germanic or homeric poetry all their lives and still found much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases 7
 nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce; in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation
 reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem; no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruins of heorot or the palace of priam
 a ship at dry-dock could be called a foamy-necked floater in anglo-saxon or a swift ship in greek
 even when defenseless of weapons the danes would be gar-dene and priam would be |e|u|m|m|e|l|i|h|s
 achilles like siegfried in the nibelungenlied is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly be called swift-footed even when he stands idle
 in coriolanus the agnomen of marcius is used deliberately and pointedly but the homeric epithets and the anglo-saxon kennings are used casually and recall to the hearer a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent
 the epic language was not entirely the servant of the poet; it was partly his master
 the poet's intentions are difficult to discern and except to biographers unimportant; the language however is a proper object of scrutiny and the effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable
 beowulf and the homeric poems appear oral compositions 6
 yet they are written; at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed
 albert b lord suggests that the homeric poems were dictated to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it would be useless to his guild and magoun argues that the beowulf poet and cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion
 this explanation is attractive but is vitiated at least in part by the observation that cynewulf though he used kennings in the traditional manner was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes into his works
 if cynewulf was literate the beowulf poet may have been also and so may the final redactor of the iliad and the odyssey 5
 in lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate bard one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry recited and became intimately familiar with the established aids to poetizing and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of the compositions of the past
 other theories of origin are compatible with the formulaic theory: beowulf may contain a design for terror and the iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering to a ceramic pattern produced during the geometric period in pottery
 the account of the growth and final transcription of these epics rests partly however upon the degree to which they were formulaic 9
 carl eduard schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated exactly in the two homeric poems and by increasing this figure so as to include lines repeated with very slight modifications he counted 2118 different lines used a total of 5612 times 4
 thus one line in five from the iliad and the odyssey is to be found somewhere else in the two poe ms
 the ratio is thoroughly remarkable because the lines are so long- half again as long as those of beowulf
 anglo-saxon poetry appears to have no comparable amount of repetition; there is no reason to think that the scop used and re-used whole lines and even lengthy passages after the manner of his homeric colleague
 in determining the extent to which any poem is formulaic it is idle however to inspect nothing besides lines repeated in their entirety for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provided for prosodic needs 5
 the closest scrutiny is owed to the anglo-saxon kennings and the homeric epithets; if any words or phrases are formulaic they will be 6
 the iliad has two words for the shield |a|s|p|i|s and |s|a|k|o|s 7
 recent criticism of great expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content to show as m d zabel has said of dickens generally that much of the novel's impact resides in its allegoric insight and moral metaphor
 j h miller's excellent chapter on great expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective 5
 in his analysis however he touches upon but fails to explore an idea generally neglected in discussions of the book which i believe is central to its art- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative
 this essay seeks to make that exploration
 dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great victorian writers
 he knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession- that in fiction as in the theatre gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response
 it is hardly accidental therefore that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands 12
 in great expectations the hands become almost an obsession 9
 mr jaggers habitually bites his forefinger a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates half terrifies all who have dealings with him 6
 miss havisham's withered hands heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them move in restless self-pity between her broken heart and her walking stick
 pumblechook's signature is the perpetually extended glad hand 9
 wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction by regularly rubbing his hands together
 old mr pocket's frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless social-climbing wife is to put his two hands into his disturbed hair and make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it whereas joe gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of mrs joe by apologetically drawing the back of his hand across and across his nose 5
 such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark were it not that in great expectations as in no other of dickens' nove ls hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them
 dickens not only reveals character through gesture he makes hands a crucial element of the plot a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt pursuit crime greed education materialism enslavement friendship romantic love forgiveness and redemption
 we have only to think of lady macbeth or the policeman-murderer in thomas burke's famous story the hands of mr ottermole to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment
 so it is with great expectations whether the hands be orlick's as he strikes down mrs gargery or pip's as he steals a pie from her pantry
 such associations suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects of dickens' novel but on a deeper plane they relate to the themes of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics
 the novel opens with a fugitive convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being laid hands on- a mysterious figure who looks into pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in 7
 magwitch terrifies pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a bogy man who may softly creep h his way to him and tear him open in him
 as pip agonizes over the theft that his own hands have committed his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost transforming it into a phantom devoting me to the hulks 6
 held upside down in the graveyard pip clings in terror with both hands to his convict; later he flees in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which he has brought to gargery's forge for mending
 through such details dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond between pip and magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter both their lives
 since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into deeds hands naturally represent action and since nearly half the characters in great expectations are of the underworld or closely allied to it the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at 5
 dickens for excellent psychological reasons never fully reveals magwitch's felonious past but pip at the convict's climactic reappearance in london shrinks from clasping a hand which he fears might be stained with blood
 orlick slouches about the forge like cain with his hands in his pockets and when he shouts abuse at mrs joe for objecting to his holiday she claps her hands in a tantrum beats them upon her bosom and upon her knees and clenches them in her husband's hair
 this last rampage is only the prelude to the vicious blow upon her head dealt by some unknown hand whose identity is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action- the tracing of orlick's hammer upon a slate
 pip himself is to feel the terror of orlick's murderous hand in his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marshes 5
 dickens lays great emphasis on the hands in this scene 8
 orlick shakes his hand at pip bangs the table with his fist draws his unclenched hand across his mouth as if his mouth watered for his victim lets his hands hang loose and heavy at his sides and pip observes him so intensely that he knows of the slightest action of his fingers
 orlick might almost be magwitch's bogy man come alive a figure of nemesis from pip's phantasy of guilt
 the scarred disfigured wrists of mr jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister past for her master coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests makes a point of the force of grip there is in these hands
 jaggers' iron control over her any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling rests on his having once got her acquitted of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails
 it is the similarity between estella's hands and molly's that provides pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of satis house
 finally magwitch's pursuit of compeyson his archenemy and betrayer begins by his holding him in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates in his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which compeyson drowns
 magwitch's hand here ironically becomes the agent of justice 6
 but only in one of its aspects is great expectations a tale of violence revenge and retribution
 money so important a theme elsewhere in dickens is here central and hands are often associated in some way with the false values- acquisitiveness snobbery self-interest hypocrisy toadyism irresponsibility injustice- that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth
 dickens suggests the economic evils of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of pip's five little dead brothers who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle who seemed to have all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets and had never taken them out in this state of existence
 pip's great expectations his progress through illusion and disillusionment turn somewhat as they do for the naive hero of dreiser's american tragedy upon the lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income- what wemmick calls portable property and what jaggers reproaches pip for letting slip through his fingers 4
 since a gentleman must if possible avoid sullying them by work his hands as importantly as his accent become the index of social status
 almost the first step in the corruption of pip's values is the unworthy shame he feels when estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands: they had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar appendages
 pip imagines how estella would look down upon joe's hands roughened by work in the smithy and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which pip struggles- idleness and work artificiality and naturalness gentility and commonness coldness and affection- in fact between satis house and the forge
 when the snobbery that alienates pip from joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which pip exclaims no don't wipe it off- for god's sake give me your blackened hand! pip's abject leave-taking of miss havisham during which he kneels to kiss her hand signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour; when on the journey to london that immediately follows he pauses nostalgically to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village the wooden pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity
 incidentally one cannot miss the significance of this gesture for dickens reintroduces it associatively in pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis- his painful recognition in a talk with herbert pocket that his hopeless attachment to estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic
 in both cases the finger-post represents pip's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms
 a variety of hand movements helps dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world pip encounters beyond the forge
 the vulturelike attendance of the pocket family upon miss havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of miss camilla pocket who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of grief-stricken choking then lays it upon her heaving bosom with an unnatural fortitude of manner and finally kisses it to miss havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward estella 4
 pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self-aggrandizement
 we first see him shaking mrs joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid to her husband for pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping pip's hands for the hundredth time at least in effusive congratulation to pip on his expectations
 we take leave of pumblechook as he gloats over pip's loss of fortune extending his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and exhibiting the same fat five fingers one of which he identifies with the finger of providence and shakes at pip in a canting imputation of the latter's ingratitoode and his own generosity as pip's earliest benefactor
 pip first learns the stupendous power of money from the sycophantic tailor mr trabb whose brutality to his boy helper exactly matches the financial resource of each new customer and whose fawning hands touch the outside of each elbow and rub pip out of the shop 4
 the respectability which money confers implies a different etiquette and upon taking up the life of a london gentleman pip must learn from herbert pocket that the spoon is not generally used over-hand but under

 the operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation cards but may end with the comma following any parameter
 remarks may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provided they are separated from the operand by at least two blank spaces
 illustration of the use of continuation cards are included throughout the examples illustrating the various statements 6
 if a continuation card follows a statement that does not permit continuation cards the compiler will generate a nop and issue an error message
 additional restrictions regarding the use of continuation cards with macro-instructions appear on page 106
 electronic switches the assignment of actual addresses to symbolic index word and electronic switch names occurs in phase 3 of the autocoder processor
 the initial availability of index words and electronic switches is determined by a table which is included in the compiler systems tape 6
 this table originally indicates that index words 1 through 96 and electronic switches 1 through 30 are available for assignment to symbolic references; index words 97 through 99 are not available 6
 the initial setting of this table may be altered however as described in the 70707074 data processing system bulletin ibm 70707074 compiler system: operating procedure form j28-6105 5
 during the first pass of phase 3 references to the actual addresses of index words and electronic switches are collected and the availability table is updated
 at the end of this pass the table indicates which index words and electronic switches are not available for assignment to symbolic references
 both index words and electronic switches may have been made unavailable before the start of assignment in one of the following ways: the initial setting of the availability table indicated that the index word or electronic switch was not available for assignment 8
 the one- two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify indexing or as a parameter which is always an index word or electronic switch eg   the one- or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch was used in the operand of an equ statement eg    when the index words or electronic switches are reserved because of actual usage in the statements described above the position or order of the statements within the program is not important; any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass
 during the assignment pass of phase 3 index words and electronic switches are reserved as they are encountered during assignment
 index words and electronic switches may be reserved in the following ways
 the first two methods apply to both index words and electronic switches; the third applies only to index words
 during the assignment pass each instruction is examined for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic switch 7
 when such a reference is found an actual address is assigned and the availability table is changed so that the assigned index word or switch is no longer available for later assignment
 if the one- or two-digit address of an index word or electronic switch is used or is included in the operand of an xreserve or sreserve statement the corresponding index word or electronic switch is reserved 5
 if a statement has been assigned an address in the index word area  by means of an origin statement which refers to an actual address the corresponding index word will be reserved
 these entries should normally appear at the beginning of the program or immediately following each litorigin statement 9
 otherwise symbolic names may have previously been assigned to these same index words
 the preceding methods allow efficient use of index words and electronic switches during a sectionalized or multi-phase program particularly when used in conjunction with the litorigin statement 5
 extreme caution should be used however to avoid the conflicting usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address 7
 if the symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appears or is included in the operand of an xrelease or srelease statement the specified index word or electronic switch will again be made available regardless of the method by which it was reserved
 it will not however be used for symbolic assignment until all other index words or electronic switches have been assigned for the first time
 if at any time during the assignment pass the compiler finds that there are no more index words available for assignment the warning message no more index words available will be placed in the object program listing the table will be altered to show that index words 1 through 96 are available and the assignment will continue as before 5
 if the compiler finds that there are no more electronic switches available for assignment the warning message no more electronic switches available will be placed in the object program listing the table will be altered to show that electronic switches 1 through 30 are available and assignment will continue as before
 the resultant conflicting usage of index words or electronic switches may be avoided by reducing the number of symbolic names used eg through the proper use of the equ xrelease or srelease statements
 as noted in appendix c index words 97 through 99 are never available for assignment to symbolic names by the compiler; also index words 93 through 96 may have been made unavailable for assignment 7
 statements autocoder declarative statements provide the processor with the necessary information to complete the imperative operations properly
 declarative statements are never executed in the object program and should be separated from the program instruction area placed preferably at its beginning or end
 otherwise special care must be taken to branch around them so that the program will not attempt to execute something in a data area as an instruction
 if the compiler does encounter such statements a warning message will be issued
 70707074 autocoder includes the following declarative statements: da dc drdw dsw dline equ code dtf diocs and duf 5
 da dc dtf and dline require more than one entry
 the da statement is used to name and define the positions and length of fields within an area
 the dc statement is used to name and enter constants into the object program
 since the 7070 and 7074 make use of record definition words to read write move and otherwise examine blocks of storage the da and dc statements provide the option of generating rdws automatically 5
 when so instructed autocoder will generate one or more rdws and assign them successive locations immediately preceding the area with which they are to be associated
 an rdw will be of the form f where xxxx is the starting location of the area and yyyy is its ending location
 these addresses are calculated automatically by the processor 10
 in some cases it may be more advantageous to assign locations to rdws associated with da and dc areas in some other part of storage ie not immediately preceding the da or dc areas
 the drdw statement may be used for this purpose 10
 the drdw statement may also be used to generate an rdw defining any area specified by the programmer
 as many as ten digital switches may be named and provided by the dsw statement for consideration by the setsw and logic macro-instructions
 each switch occupies one digit position in a word can be set on or off and is considered as logically equivalent to an electronic switch
 it cannot however be referred to by electronic switch commands eg esn bsn etc
 an individual switch or the entire set of switches in a word may be tested or altered as desired
 through use of the dline statement a means is provided for specifying both the editing of fields to be inserted in a print line area and the layout of the area itself
 the area may include constant information supplied by the programmer
 the area may also be provided with additional data during the running of the object program by means of edmov or move macro-instructions
 the declarative statement equ permits the programmer to equate symbolic names to actual index words electronic switches arm and file numbers tape channel and unit numbers alteration switches etc and to equate a symbol to another symbol or to an actual address 4
 the diocs dtf and duf statements are used when required by the inputoutput control system
 diocs is used to select the major methods of processing to be used and to name the index words used by iocs
 each tape file must be described by tape file specifications produced by dtfs
 in addition to information related to the file and its records the file specifications contain subroutine locations and the location of tape label information
 a duf entry must be supplied for every unit record file describing the type of file and the unit record equipment to be used 6
 the duf also supplies the locations of subroutines written by the user that are unique to the file
 a full description of the diocs dtf and duf statements is contained in the 7070 data processing system bulletin ibm 7070 inputoutput control system form j28-6033- 1
 brief descriptions of these three declarative statements and detailed descriptions of the formats and functions of each of the other 70707074 autocoder declarative statements follow below 5
 when the inputoutput control system is to be used in a program a diocs statement must be used to select the major methods of processing to be used
 this statement also allows the naming of the index words used by iocs
 the basic format of the diocs statement is as follows:  anylabel is any symbolic label; it may be omitted
 the entry dio cs must be written exactly as shown
 the first item in the operand iocsixf is used to specify the first iocs index word for programs using tape files
 this item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3-94
 if the first item in the operand is omitted the symbolic name iocsixf will be assigned
 when an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified autocoder will equate the name iocsixf to it
 the second item in the operand iocsixg is used to specify the second iocs index word for programs using tape files 7
 this item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3-94
 if the second item in the operand is omitted the symbolic name iocsixg will be assigned
 when an actual index word or a symbolic address is specified autocoder will equate iocsixg to it
 in the midwest oxidation ponds are used extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban areas
 the high cost of land and a few operational problems resulting from excessive loadings have created the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristics of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume 6
 research at fayette missouri on oxidation ponds has shown that the bod in the treated effluent varied from 30 to 53 mgl with loadings from 8 to 120 lb boddayacre
 since experience indicates that effluents from oxidation ponds do not create major problems at these bod concentrations the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerated treatment system was the same as from conventional oxidation ponds
 recent studies by weston and stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer
 their study showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygenhrhp
 o'connor and eckenfelder discussed the use of aerated lagoons for treating organic wastes
 they indicated that a 4-day retention aerated lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent bod reduction
 later eckenfelder increased the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer months
 it appeared from the limited information available that the aerated lagoon might offer a satisfactory means of increasing the capacity of existing oxidation ponds as well as providing the same degree of treatment in a smaller volume
 with the development of the red bridge subdivision south of kansas city missouri the developer was faced with the problem of providing adequate sewage disposal
 the sewage system from kansas city was not expected to serve the red bridge area for several years
 this necessitated the construction of temporary sewage treatment facilities with an expected life from 5 to 15 yr 8
 for the initial development an oxidation pond was constructed as shown in figure 1
 the oxidation pond has a surface area of 4 10
 77 acres and a depth of 4 ft
 the pond is currently serving 1230 persons or 260 persons per acre
 in the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors
 it was possible to maintain aerobic conditions in the pond by regular additions of sodium nitrate until the temperature decreased and the algae population changed from blue-green to green algae 7
 the anaerobic conditions in the existing oxidation pond necessitated examination of other methods for supplying additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate
 at the same time further expansion in the red bridge subdivision required the construction of additional sewage treatment facilities 12
 the large land areas required for oxidation ponds made this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer
 it was proposed that aerated lagoons be used to eliminate the problem at the existing oxidation ponds and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development
 the lack of adequate data on the aerated lagoon system prompted the developer to construct an aerated lagoon pilot plant to determine its feasibility for treating domestic sewage
 the pilot plant was a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom 4 ft below the surface with a volume of 121000 gal
 the side slopes were coated with fiberglas matting coated with asphalt to prevent erosion
 the pilot lagoon was located as shown in figure 1 to serve the area just south of the existing housing area
 the major contributor was a shopping center with houses being added to the system as the subdivision developed
 the pilot lagoon was designed to handle the wastes from 314 persons with a 4-day aeration period
 initially the wastewater would be entirely from the shopping center with the domestic sewage from the houses increasing over an 18-month period
 this operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant with a slowly increasing load over a reasonable period of time 6
 the pilot plant was equipped with a 3- hp turbine aerator 8
 the aerator had a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range of speeds
 the sewage flow into the treatment plant was metered and continuously recorded on 24-hr charts
 the raw sewage was introduced directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mixing of the raw sewage with the aeration tank contents
 the effluent was collected through two pipes and discharged to the blue river through a surface drainage ditch
 composite samples were collected at weekly intervals 9
 the long retention period and the complete mixing concept prevented rapid changes in either the mixed liquor or in the effluent 7
 weekly samples would make any changes more readily discernible than daily samples
 the composite samples were normally collected over a 6-hr period but an occasional 24-hr composite was made
 examination of the operations of the shopping center permitted correlation of the 6-hr composite samples with 24-hr operations 7
 the data indicated that the organic load during the 6-hr composites was essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr organic load 7
 grab samples were collected from the existing oxidation pond to determine its operating conditions
 efforts were made to take the grab samples at random periods so that the mass of data could be treated as a 6- hr composite sample 6
 a single 24-hr composite sample indicated that the sewage flow pattern and characteristics were typical
 operations the bod of the influent to the pilot plant varied between 110 and 710 mgl with an average of 350 mgl 6
 this was equivalent to 240 mglbod on a 24-hr basis 11
 the bod of the raw sewage was typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision
 the bod in the effluent averaged 58 mgl a 76-per cent reduction over the 24-hr period
 examination of the data in table 1 shows that a few samples contributed to raising the effluent bod
 the periods of high effluent bod occurred during cold periods when operational problems with the aerator resulted
 ice caused the aerator to overload straining the drive belts 6
 the slippage of the drive belts caused the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer as well as the mixing of the raw sewage 8
 the organic loading on the unit averaged 32 lb of bodday or about 2 lb bodday1000 cu ft aeration capacity
 needless to say the organic load was very low on a volumetric basis but was 270 lb boddayacre on a surface loading basis 6
 it seems that the aerated lagoon was a very heavily loaded oxidation pond or a lightly loaded activated sludge system 7
 the flow rate remained relatively constant during the winter months as shown in table 1
 with the spring rains the flow rose rapidly due to infiltration in open sewers
 as construction progresses the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduced
 the retention period in the aerated lagoon ranged from 9 7
 6 days averaging 6
 the large amount of vegetable grindings from the grocery store in the shopping center created a suspended solids problem 6
 the vegetables were not readily metabolized by the bacteria in the aeration unit and tended to float on the surface
 a skimming device at the effluent weir prevented loss of most of these light solids
 the average volatile suspended solids in the effluent was 75 mgl while mlss averaged 170 mgl volatile suspended solids 7
 the average sludge age based on displacement of solids was calculated to be 14
 the oxygen uptake rate in the mixed liquor averaged 0 9
 8 mglhr during the first four months of this study 7
 variations in aerator speeds during the latter two months of this study caused increased mixing and increased oxygen demand 6
 the increase in oxygen uptake rates from 1
 6 mglhr which followed an increase in rotor speed was believed to be related to resuspension of solids which had settled at the lower rotor speeds
 it appeared that most of the mixed liquor suspended solids were active microbial solids with the heavier less active solids settling out
 the suspended solids discharged in the effluent were found to be the major source of the bod
 removal of the suspended solids by a membrane filter yielded an average effluent containing only 20 mgl bod
 the bod in the drainage ditch receiving the pilot plant effluent averaged 12 mgl
 this low bod was due to removal of the excess suspended solids by sedimentation since the only dilution was surface runoff which was very low during this study
 routine microscopic examinations were made of the mixed liquor as indicated by mckinney and gram for the various types of protozoa 7
 it was found that the aerated lagoon was an activated sludge system rather than an oxidation pond
 at no time were algae found in the mixed liquor 13
 the bacteria formed typical activated sludge floc 9
 the floc particles were all small as the heavier floc settled out 9
 initially the flagellated protozoa predominated but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated protozoa
 as the temperature decreased the number of free swimming ciliated protozoa decreased
 very little protozoa activity existed below 40`f
 when the temperature reached 32`f all protozoan activity ceased; but as the temperature rose the numbers of protozoa increased rapidly 9
 only once were stalked ciliates found in the mixed liquor 7
 the predomination of free swimming ciliated protozoa is indicative of a high bacterial population
 one of the important aspects of this study was to determine the oxygen transfer relationships of the mechanical aerator 10
 routine determinations were made for dissolved oxygen in the mixed liquor and for oxygen uptake rates
 the data given in table 2 show the routine operation of the aerator
 the dissolved oxygen in the aeration unit was consistently high until january 29 1961
 an extended cold spell caused ice to build up on the aerator which was mounted on a floating platform and caused the entire platform to sink lower in the water
 the added resistance to the rotor damaged the drive belts and reduced the oxygen transfer capacity
 it was approximately one month before the belt problem was noticed and corrected but at no time was there a deficiency of dissolved oxygen
 a series of eight special tests were conducted at different rotor speeds to determine the oxygen transfer rate
 five of the tests were conducted with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover
 the rate of oxygen transfer at 1
 0-mgl dissolved oxygen concentration and 10`c for various rotor speeds is given in table 3
 the maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 1
 0 mgl dissolved oxygen was calculated as 220 lbday at a maximum rate of 9
 the actual power requirements indicated 2lb oxygen transferhrhp
 the polyethylene cover reduced the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent indicating that the maximum oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface
 pond during this study septic conditions developed in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted
 shortly after this study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of sodium nitrate
 the location of the oxidation pond in a high-value residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer 7
 the organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 160 to 270 mgl of bod with an average of 230 mgl
 the bod data are given in table 4
 a single 24-hr composite sample had a bod of 260 mgl indicating a typical domestic sewage
 the daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 147000 gpd giving a retention period of 42 days
 the organic loading on the pond was slightly under 60lbboddayacre
 the effluent bod averaged 34 mgl a little lower than that of the study at fayette indicated for a loading of 60lb boddayacre 7
 the bod of the effluent ranged from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47mgl
 microscopic examination of the effluent showed that minimum bod occurred when the algae began to decrease with cold weather 6
 when the algae began to build up again the effluent bod rose 8
 during the two weeks when the algae disappeared from the effluent bod's in the effluent were 18 and 16 mgl
 thus the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations are defense of shipping defense of naval forces and area defense 6
 the last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and near terminals and bases
 to effect these operations five elements exist fixed installations
 surface forces have been used to provide defense zones around naval and merchant ship formations air to furnish area surveillance and mines for protection of limited areas
 submarines and shore installations are new elements 7
 the submarine now has a definite place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to ocean areas
 fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection 7
 mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets 8
 a sixth element not always considered is intelligence 8
 it includes operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment
 operational intelligence presumably will be available from our national intelligence agencies; intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augmented program in oceanography 4
 the major postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting
 thinking on submarine defense has not always been clear-cut 6
 proponents of single elements tend to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents has assumed the greatest importance
 consequently air surface and submarine elements overshadow the mine fixed installations and intelligence
 these have sought more and more of what they have 12
 each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others
 this despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are necessarily mutually supporting
 thus the most productive areas are not necessarily the most stressed
 this is stated to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense one which would provide positions of relative importance to asw elements based on projected potentialities 8
 then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective 6
 an over-all concept would have other advantages 10
 it would allow presentation to the public of a unified approach 10
 now the problem is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily
 while one element is announcing progress another is delineating its problems
 the result can only be confusion in the public mind 10
 a unified concept can serve as a guide to budgeting and if public support is gained will command congressional support 6
 industry's main criticism of the navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how
 lacking guidance industry picks its own areas
 the result coupled with the salesmanship for which american industry is famous is considerable expenditure of funds and efforts in marginal areas
 an over-all concept will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield greatest dividends
 therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine defense is needed for co-ordination of the navy's efforts for a logical presentation to the public for industry's guidance and as a basis for a program to the congress
 concept that which follows will be a discussion of principles and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare
 russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world divided between her various fleets
 some are also in albania and others are on loan to egypt 7
 other countries which may willingly or unwillingly become communist can furnish bases
 communist target areas can be assumed but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide with soviet intentions 7
 attack can come from almost any direction against many locations 8
 logically then the first principle of the plan must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area
 it is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while building at bases in transit and on station
 destruction of the enemy's building and base complex however requires attacks on enemy territory which is possible only in event of all-out hostilities
 in transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarines until commission of an overt act
 the communists are adept at utilizing hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is to their advantage
 therefore the second principle of the plan must be that while providing for all-out hostilities its effectiveness is not dependent on general war
 antisubmarine warfare does not involve clashes between large opposing forces with the decision a result of a single battle 5
 it is a war of attrition of single actions of an exchange of losses
 this exchange must result in our ending up with some effective units
 initially having fewer units of some elements- especially submarines- than the opponent our capabilities need to be sufficiently greater than theirs so that the exchange will be in our favor
 therefore the third principle of the plan must be that it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types unless at an assured favorable exchange rate
 the submarine has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since world war 2
 its speed has increased it operates at increasingly greater depths its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited and it will become even more silent
 the next developments will probably be in weaponry 13
 the missile can gradually be expected to replace the torpedo 9
 as detection ranges increase weapons will be developed to attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges 8
 therefore the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increasing capabilities in the opponent 6
 no element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense
 some elements support the others but all have limitations 8
 some limitations of one element can be compensated for by a capability of another
 elements used in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capabilities of the individual elements
 therefore the plan's fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of all elements in combination
 conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solved by sufficient forces
 numbers would be astronomical and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution
 shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon programs indicate that there will not be enough of anything
 therefore any measures taken in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute greatly to success when hostilities occur
 therefore the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures which will reduce future force requirements
 the world is constantly changing; what was new yesterday is obsolescent today
 the seventh principle of the plan is self-evident; it must be flexible enough to allow for technological breakthroughs scientific progress and changes in world conditions
 to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense has been demonstrated the mission has been stated broad principles delineating its content laid down and the supporting elements listed
 before considering these elements in more detail an additional requirement should be stated
 large area coverage will accomplish all other tasks 9
 therefore because reduction in tasks results in reduction of forces required the plan should provide for expanding area coverage 5
 but it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented geographically
 consequently the system giving area coverage must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile
 since effective area coverage appears fairly remote the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements: air surface sub-surface fixed installations mines and intelligence 6
 these are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result 7
 intelligence as used herein will include information on possible opponents and on the environment which can affect operations 7
 these can be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence
 in submarine defense these must have maximum stress 11
 good operational intelligence can ensure sound planning greatly reduce force requirements and increase tactical effectiveness 6
 environmental intelligence is just as important 10
 the ocean presently co-operates with the target 9
 full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to our side resulting in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactics a decrease in enemy capabilities and the development of methods of capitalizing on the environment 6
 therefore improved intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and as it supports all other elements rates a top priority
 gathering intelligence is important but of equal importance is its translation into usable form
 a program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic research into tactical and operating instructions
 approaching this problem on a statistical basis is invalid because the opponent has the same sources available and will be encountered not under average conditions but under the conditions most advantageous to him
 therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating instructions based on measurement of conditions in the area at the time of encounter
 all capabilities must be used to maximum advantage then 12
 temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and animal life are the chief environmental variables
 variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperatu re because more of the variables would be encompassed 7
 these variations must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically
 progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging but little guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information
 a concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on the spot
 mine warfare has in the past been directed against surface targets 9
 by its nature it has always been of great psychological advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater counter-efforts 6
 mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine targets 9
 they are still considered to be for use in restricted waters however and targets must come within a few yards of them 8
 mines need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment extended to deep water and have their effective area per unit increased
 mines can be used to deny access to great areas; they are difficult to counter cost little to maintain until required and can be put into place quickly
 a most attractive feature is that detection and attack are combined in a single package
 effective employment will reduce force requirements 8
 for example effective mine barriers from florida to cuba and across the yucatan channel from cuba to mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense inshore patrol convoy escort shipping control and mine defense for the entire gulf of mexico
 more extended systems covering all passage into the caribbean would free the caribbean and the gulf of mexico from the previously listed requirements
 systems covering the gulf of st lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the united states are not impossible
 such mine defense systems could permit concentration of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase in the probability of success
 the advantages inherent in mine warfare justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any of the other elements 7
 fixed installations are increasingly advocated as the problem of area defense emerges
 the proponents are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence on their military counterparts
 systems which detect submarines over wide areas are attractive although they can be only burglar alarms
 mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target 7
 such systems are expensive and are oriented geographically 8
 in an over-all asw concept dependence on and effort expended for such syste ms should be limited to those with proven capabilities 9
 no general installation should be made until a model installation has been proved and its maximum capability determined 6
 in addition proposals for fixed installations should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile system 10
 for fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval systems
 the submarine has become increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system
 it operates in its target's environment and any advantage gained therefrom by the target is shared by the attacker 7
 but the submarine is a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed
 two metabolites which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast bacteria are biosynthesized from paba 5
 the 7 carbons of paba are incorporated directly into metabolite 2 
 thirty-five of the 36 carbon atoms arise from paba 6
 all 28 carbons of metabolite 1 arise from paba 10
 metabolite 1 isolated from the medium however showed a lower specific activity which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite
 vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite 1 destroyed the biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines
 fragment a has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt and free base
 preliminary evidence tentatively indicates that the molecule is cleaved at a secondary amide bond
 h sloane; chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation - research on esterases in mammalian sera was continued 5
 one of the most interesting findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to rare earth ions
 the inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect of rare earth salts
 various metal ions have been found to protect plasma arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine 8
 the effects can be related to the structure of this -sh enzyme
 the non-identity of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established
 furthermore the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian sera and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin in addition to arylesterase
 selective inhibitors can distinguish the two activities 9
 investigations on the acceleration of human plasma cholinesterase were carried further
 biophysical studies on - electron-microscopical and physical-chemical methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured collagen and ribonucleic acid
 a method was devised for extracting and purifying soluble earthworm collagen 
 it was observed that ewc macromolecules are the same diameter than vertebrate tropocollagen
 this unusual collagen also was shown to undergo a reversible thermal phase transformation
 this investigation involved several aspects
 substance z an active urinary peptide was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated column chromatography; high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography were used in preliminary structural studies; pharmacological effects in vitro on isolated surviving organs and in vivo on blood pressure were assayed; special equipment required for registering respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles under various conditions was developed by the instruments section ; and enzymes which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps substance z were studied
 experiments are in progress to develop ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques for assaying these enzymes and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions
 c d mackey a g renfrew w b severs - in a physiochemical study of seed proteins the globulins of the brazil nut have been investigated 5
 in addition to the known principal globulin excelsin three other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed 13
 a water-soluble protein of quite low molecular weight has also been found in this system and partly characterized
 on the basis of a differentiability assumption in function space it is possible to prove that for materials having the property that the stress is given by a functional of the history of the deformation gradients the classical theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation has been infinitesimal for all times in the past
 by strengthening the differentiability assumption it has been possible to derive second and higher order theories of viscoelasticity 6
 in the second-order theory one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the first-order stress relaxation function 10
 an extensive series of measurements was made on a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum instrument using forced sinusoidal oscillation free vibration and creep measurements over the temperature range of f to 80`c
 as many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally
 the simple time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous systems did not hold here
 it was possible however to decompose the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two viscoelastic mechanisms each compatible with the boltzmann superposition principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence factors 7
 and related - the results of microanalysis of tektites for gallium and germanium have shown that these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial matter by impact of a celestial body 5
 the galliumgermanium ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous metamorphic or sedimentary matter as a result of selective volatilization of the components of the tektite
 gallium oxide is less volatile than silica and germanium oxide is more volatile
 australites give the appearance of a second melting 12
 in conformity with this conclusion a higher trace gallium content was found in the portion that has undergone a second melting
 the silicate fractions of stony meteorites show galliumgermanium ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone melting at some point in their histories
 libyan desert silica-glass another natural glass is composed of nearly pure silica and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area
 the gallium content however has been enhanced five-fold 11
 this glass is probably formed from libyan desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite impact
 nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy to produce large terrestrial-explosion craters may nevertheless melt only small quantities of material
 most of the impact energy is spent in crushing and fragmentation
 when rapid quenching follows melting impact glasses may result 11
 these always contain metallic inclusions
 impact glasses not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been produced by stony meteorites or comets
 no meteorites have ever been recovered from paleoexplosion craters and recent craters containing impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception of aouelloul crater adrar western sahara desert
 this crater contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic material has been recovered
 preparation of a coordination compound is often accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol
 by applying this general principle a great number of complex compounds of osmium ruthenium iridium and rhenium with triphenylphosphine triphenylarsine and triphenylstibine have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few years 7
 in the absence of direct evidence to the contrary decomposition of solvent alcohol and coordination of its fragments to the metal were not considered following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in preparative coordination chemistry
 recent work with radiocarbon and deuterated alcohols as solvents however has given evidence that metal-hydrido and -carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction with alcohol in some of these systems
 some of the previously reported compounds have thus been reformulated and a series of new hydrido and carbonyl compounds discovered the more representative examples being f f f f and f 6
 the coordination complexes formed by transition metals with primary and secondary phosphines and arsines are being investigated 7
 particular interest is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes
 during the past year these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes of nickel and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged complexes of palladium as well as new compounds of the well-known type f
 the structures properties and reactions of these compounds are being studied
 in another study chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species prepared homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis are being characterized and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed under varying preparative conditions 6
 _elasticity - the theory of elasticity of gaussian networks has been developed on a more general basis and the equations of state relating variables of pressure volume temperature stress and strain have been precisely formulated
 simple elongation has been treated in detail
 the various stress-temperature coefficients for constancy of volume and strain constancy of pressure and strain and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated
 the dilation accompanying elongation and the simultaneously developed anisotropy of compressibility have been related to the elongation
 in continuation of these theoretical studies a more precise elucidation of the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought
 chain conformations of polymeric - recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions of polymeric chains by volkenstein and lifson has been extended to include more general types of chains 6
 the mean-square end- to-end distance of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement with values deduced from viscosity data
 these studies are being extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the hindrances to rotation around chain bonds
 the crystallization of copolymers comprising f units interspersed with a minor percentage of f is limited by the inability of the crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky side group of the latter
 only uninterrupted sequences of the former are eligible for formation of crystallites
 limitations on the lengths of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short crystallites which can be formed and this is reflected in a broadening of the melting range 6
 carefully executed melting studies on this system permit quantitative estimation of the instability engendered by reduced crystallite length
 the complex morphology of polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor
 hence the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations in the latter field
 glycerinated muscle in the presence of the physiological agent 8
 responsible for delivering energy to the mechanochemically active proteins of muscle has been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly sensitive both to temperature and to solvent composition in mixtures of alcohols and water
 experiments carried out over long periods of time in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of several degrees centigrade and to a concentration range of only several per cent
 the contraction therefore partakes of the character of a phase transition
 while atp appears to be necessary for the occurrence of contraction its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction 6
 one of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques is the synthesis of polymers of extremely narrow molecular weight distribution
 a simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed 5
 the preparation of such products is not new but the systems heretofore employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental skill and starting materials of a high purity 7
 in the new process impurities present in the solvent the monomer and in the reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of initiator a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium at a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth 5
 upon completion of the purging step additional initiator appropriate for the molecular weight of the sample desired is added and the system is then warmed to the polymerization temperature at which the reaction is allowed to go to completion
 the predictability of the molecular weights was found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared with f ratios less than 1 5
 contrary to observations with ethers no apparent change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable periods of time in benzene as solvent

 all crystalline substances and other solid-state materials 9
 the aim is to collect a very broad range of physical chemical morphological and structural data for crystals on an encyclopedic scale and to seek all possible useful and revealing correlations of properties with internal structure
 the first stage of operation has centered on the literature imaging of critical or summarizing tabulations such as the barker index
 coverage of primary literature will follow 10
 unpublished data will be available to the groth institute from cooperating groups and individuals
 critical evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this project
 however the proposed correlation of the many interrelated properties of crystals will reveal discrepancies in the recorded data and suggest areas for reinvestigation
 in addition the availability of computers will permit recalculation and refinement of much structural information 11
 physical for punched-card or tape storage of information all literature values must be conformed to a common language 5
 in this way a degree of unification of nomenclature symbols and units will be realized
 because individual classes of foods differ in their requirements for preservation a number of methods have been developed over the years involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration fermentation salting chemical treatment canning refrigeration and freezing
 the basic objectives in each instance are to make available supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and insects and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of harvest or production to areas of consumption
 in earlier years the preservation of food was essentially related to survival
 in the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations food-preservation techniques have sought also to bring variety peak freshness and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the comsumer
 with the development of nuclear technology isotopic materials and machine radiation sources in recent years the possibilities of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted the attention of investigators in the united states and throughout the world
 an early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled 7
 interest remained however in the possibility that it would serve as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing or without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations
 the chief factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are microorganisms such as bacteria molds and yeasts insects sprouting and chemical reactions
 microorganisms are often responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods
 of special concern is the growth of bacteria such as clostridium botulinum which generate poisonous products
 enzymatic action in stored food produces changes which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability 5
 spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group of components in the food with others or with its environment as in corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with oxygen in the air to produce rancidity
 sprouting is a naturally occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes onions carrots beets and similar root vegetables
 insect infestation is a problem of importance chiefly in stored grain
 the presence of parasitic organisms such as trichinella spiralis in pork introduces another factor which must be dealt with in food processing
 to permit the storage of food for long periods of time a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic action
 the term sterilization applies to methods involving essential ly complete destruction of all microorganisms
 food treated in this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without refrigeration
 the process of pasteurization involves milder and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction of most but not all of the microorganisms
 less severe thermal treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes
 effects of ionizing radiation ionizing radiation can cause the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage or at lower doses can inhibit their action
 it furnishes a means of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic organisms present in meats 9
 deactivation of enzymes is also possible although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 mrad or mor e
 because of undesirable flavors odors colors and generally low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching
 radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food 6
 it will however inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables
 the radiation doses required for the preservation of foods are in the following ranges:  for radiosterilization to destroy all organisms for long-term preservation- about 4
 5 mrad for nonacid foods of low salt content 11
 for radiopasteurization to partially destroy microorganisms; results vary with types of food storage conditions and objectives of treatment- commonly of the order of 0
 2 mrads but up to about 0
 for destruction of insects- about 25000 rads
 for inhibiting the sprouting of root vegetables- 4000 to 10000 rads
 preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side effects particularly at the higher radiation dosages 5
 in this respect the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized foods has to date been found to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially processed foods
 a number of foods are quite acceptable as regards taste and palatability however at dosages substantially less than sterilization levels
 moreover the nutritive value of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little if any change although some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization doses
 for irradiation of food the results obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation and x-ray gamma and high-energy electron radiation are suitable
 aside from availability and economic considerations each has certain practical advantages; for example gamma rays give deeper penetration but cannot be focused or collimated whereas unidirectional electron beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiated
 selection of a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factors including required dose rate load factor throughput convenience safety and most important costs 4
 of the potentially useful sources of ionizing radiations gamma sources cobalt-60 cesium-137 fission products or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems
 of the various particle accelerators the van de graff machines resonant transformers and linear accelerators are the principal ones available for commercial use
 costs of the effective energy produced by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation processes 9
 estimated production costs of radiation energy from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per kwhr
 conventional energy for processing foods is available in the range of at most a few cents per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent of a few mills per kwhr for process steam
 radiation therefore is at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization or radiosterilization
 what are the possibilities of lowered radiation production costs for the future? 13
  it has been estimated that for applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood of 10 cents per kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for gamma radiation generated in a reactor core
 no comparable reductions in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen
 such projections however appear highly speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond those foreseen for food-preservation facilities
 because agricultural activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest of many foods are widely scattered geographically and because of the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance to a central processing location the use of large central processing stations where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt range might be utilized is inherently impracticable
 of irradiation preservation of foo ds the objective of complete sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods of time
 chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military services
 for them providing appetizing food under battle or emergency conditions is a paramount consideration
 they require completely sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration preferably items already cooked and ready to eat 7
 high nutritional value variety palatability and appetizing appearance are important for reasons of morale
 foods for rear stations which require cooking but no refrigeration are also of interest
 of primary interest are meats
 radiopasteurization which produces fewer adverse sensory changes in food products has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items
 thus food so processed might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability 5
 commercial interest is chiefly in this type of treatment as is military interest under peacetime conditions
 the present status of food preservation by ionizing radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs 7
 the radiation processing of meat has received extensive investigation
 to date the one meat showing favorable results at sterilization doses is pork
 of particular interest to the military services is the demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization is superior in palatability to available canned pork products
 tests with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development of off-flavors
 a prime objective of the army quartermaster corps program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means of overcoming it since it is a major and desirable dietary item
 partly because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes before radiosterilization treated fresh meats have the appearance of boiled or canned meat
 off-flavor is a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meats but problems of commercial acceptability remain
 moderate radiation doses of from 100000 to 200000 rads can extend the shelf life of fresh beef from 5 days to 5 or 6 weeks 4
 however the problem of consumer acceptability remains 15
 the preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts
 cooked beef irradiated in the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color
 when lamb and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses the meat becomes dehydrated the fat become chalky and again unnatural changes in color occur
 ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping qualities 6
 however a major problem here is one of scale of processing; ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local level whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require central processing and distribution facilities 5
 the problems of color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are the same as for solid cuts
 specialty cooked items containing meat portions as in frozen dinners might offer a potential use for radiopasteurization 5
 the principal potential advantage would be that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost under refrigeration instead of being frozen
 a refrigerated item could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen foods of the same type
 competitive processes for preserving meats are by canning and freezing
 costs of canning meat are in the range of 0
 8 to 5 cents per pound; costs of freezing are in the area of 2 to 3
 the table on page 10 shows costs of canning and freezing meat and estimated costs for irradiation under certain assumed conditions 5
 under the conditions of comparison it will radiosterilization is more radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137 irradiation using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator
 results of irradiation tests with poultry have been quite successful
 at sterilizing doses good palatability results with a minimum of changes in appearance taste and odor
 radiopasteurization has also been successful and the shelf life of chicken can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared with about 10 days for the untreated product 5
 acceptable taste and odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken
 acceptance of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed however for two reasons: the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation and distributing practices and treatment by antibiotics a measure already approved by the federal food and drug administration serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0
 fresh seafood products are extremely perishable 10
 although refrigeration has served to extend the storage life of these products substantially increased consumption might be possible if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately 5
 furthermore it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms possible
 the instrument is shown in fig 1 and consists essentially of a hard sharp tungsten carbide knife which is pushed along the substrate to remove the coating
 the force required to accomplish removal is plotted by means of an electronic recorder against distance of removal
 since the removal force is a function of coating thickness a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness
 this too is recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut
 a number of adjustment features are included in the hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited on such substrates as iron and other metals glass wood and plastic surfaces
 the measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily be carried out
 hesiometer results have been found to compare excellently with manual knife scratching tests
 the instrumental method however is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical results which can be accurately repeated at wil over a period of time
 if a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle a number of removal mechanisms are often observed which depend upon the thickness of the coating
 at low thicknesses a cutting phenomenon is often encountered 11
 as the coating becomes thicker the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of failure
 if the coating becomes still thicker a peeling type failure finally can occur
 the typical appearance of these various mechanisms is illustrated in figs 2 3 and 4 which are single frame enlargements of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal process
 it can be seen from fig 2 that the cutting removal of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the coating 10
 the molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife and extending to the coating surface
 the pictures of figs 3 and 4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating is detached by failure in a region at or close to the interface between coating and substrate
 if the force required to remove the coatings is plotted against film thickness a graph as illustrated schematically in fig 5 may characteristically result
 here h is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the substrate and t is the film thickness
 it can be seen that the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly from cutting to cracking to peeling removal 8
 also it can be readily seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state response while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature
 it should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of changes in coatings thickness
 presumably the interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case
 what then are the factors that contribute to these phenomena? 8
  why should the practical adhesion of a coating as assessed by a knife method change initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing thickness? 6
  the cutting removal process has been previously described 7
 it was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely by cohesive failure
 the details of the removal process are shown schematically in fig 6
 the various forces result from the reaction of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane which makes an angle |f with the substrate
 the action and reaction forces are r and f respectively and are equal and opposite in direction
 all the other force vectors are derived from these 14
 f is the force required to cut a coating of thickness t from the substrate
 f is the shear force along the shear plane; f and f are the thrust forces acting against coating and knife respectively; f is the normal compressive force acting on the shear plane; f is the friction force between chip and knife surfaces and p is the normal force acting on the face of the knife
 |a is the rake angle of the knife; |f is the angle the shear plane makes with the substrate; |t is the friction angle; and |b is the angle the resultants make with the plane of the substrate
 an analysis of the vector relationships shows that the rake angle |a and the friction angle |t determine the vector direction f of the force resultants r and f
 consequently both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting removal process
 it is difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of r directly
 in actual practice the values most readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force f and the shear angle |f 6
 these two values and the rake angle |a are sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships
 |a is defined by the geometry of the knife; |f can readily be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after cutting from the substrate; f is instrumentally determined 4
 from fig 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be derived and the cutting force is f where |l is the shear strength of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material w is the width of the removed coating and t is its thickness
 if the cutting force f is plotted against film thickness a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope f
 however in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn
 one of these is the fact that the knife employed no matter how well sharpened will have a slightly rounded cutting edge 10
 this signifies that |a the rake angle is no longer a constant to zero film thickness
 the curvature of this bluntness is in the case of the carboloy knife employed in the hesiometer determined by the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0
 the force vector concept of fig 6 can readily be applied to this condition also
 because the rake angle f at the tip of the knife is very much smaller when compared to the value of |a for the major portion of the knife a very rapid increase in cutting force with thickness will result
 this reduces to the relationship: f where f is the intercept at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn f is the thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife tip f is a straight line first approximation of this roundness and the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn
 it can be seen that f is a constant and is determined for the most part by the geometry of the knife
 the blunter the knife the higher is the value of f 9
 the importance of a hard abrasion resistant knife material like the carboloy employed in the hesiometer immediately becomes apparent 6
 softer knives would blunt very rapidly making the value of f inexact
 in extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even change during the course of a measurement
 a second factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused by the bottom of the knife against the substrate 7
 this is not a constant value like f but varies with the thickness of the coating and the direction and magnitude of the resultants r and f of fig 6
 under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust f against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of f
 the resultant friction force f is thus directly proportional to f and consequently also to film thickness
 the value of f can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track under various external loadings 7
 a straight line relationship is usually observed in a plot of f against load l having slope k and f since the load l under actual cutting conditions is caused by f it can be seen that f   the measured force h in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the coating f that due to the bluntness of the knife f and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate f or f the first two forces are directly interrelated and depend upon film thickness whereas f is independent of these two and is a constant for a given knifecoating combination
 these theoretical relationships are more clearly illustrated in fig 7 and their sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made with the hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of fig 5 for the cutting mechanism
 although a large number of coatings systems particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place
 this is a chipping dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle coatings resins or very highly pigmented films 10
 this is shown in the photomicrograph of fig 8 12
 the basic difference between the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously without fracture rupture intermittently occurs along the shear plane
 the detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been studied extensively by merchant for metal cutting and the principles found can be directly applied to coatings
 by studying high speed movies made of this type of failure the sequence of relationships as schematically illustrated in fig 9 could be observed
 in the first picture the knife is just beginning to advance into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip formation 7
 in the next the shear plane angle is high and extends to the inclined work surface
 with increasing advance of the knife into the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear angle rapidly decreases
 eventually rupture occurs along the shear plane and the cycle repeats itself
 merchant has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area are used 5
 consequently if the shear angle |f is replaced by the rupture angle f the relationships as described in eqns will directly apply 6
 mechanism under equilibrium cutting conditions the chip exerts a force f against the coating and an equal opposite force f against the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in fig 6 5
 if the rake angle |a of the knife is high enough and the friction angle |t between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low enough to give a positive value for f the resultant vector r will lie above the plane of the substrate
 within only a few years foamed plastics materials have managed to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastics industry- and the end is still not yet in sight
 urethane foam as only one example was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955
 yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb and expectations are for a market of 275 million lb by 1964 5
 many of the other foamed plastics particularly the styrenes show similar growth potential
 and there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be evaluated
 as this issue goes to press for example one manufacturer has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength; another reports that a cellular polypropylene primarily for use in wire coating applications is being investigated 6
 on the following pages each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described in detail as to properties applications and methods of processing
 it might be well to point out however some of the newer developments that have taken place within the past few months which might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved
 in urethane foams for example there has been a definite trend toward the polyether-type materials and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot molding
 most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets 7
 urethane foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention
 in one outstanding example whirlpool corp found that by switching to urethane foam insulation they could increase the storage capacity of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models
 much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing the urethane foams including spraying frothing and molding 
 and in meeting the demands for urethane foam as a garment interlining new adhesives and new methods of laminating foam to a substrate have been developed
 new techniques for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost that particular material into a number of new consumer applications including picnic chests beverage coolers flower pots and flotation-type swimming toys
 two other end-use areas which contributed to expandable styrene's growth during the year were packaging and foamed-core building panels 8
 extruded expandable styrene film or sheet- claimed to be competitive price-wise with paper- also showed much potential particularly for packaging
 sandwich panels for building utility shelters that consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused interest in the construction field
 in vinyl foam the big news was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material 
 better hand a more luxurious feel and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result
 several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end product to any great extent
 readers interested in additional information on foams are referred to the foamed plastics chart appearing in the technical data section and to the list of references which appears below
 since the mid 1950s when urethane foam first made its appearance in the american market growth has been little short of fantastic 6
 present estimates are that production topped the 100-million-lb mark in 1960 ; by 1965 production may range from 200 to 350 million lb for flexible and from 115 to 150 million lb for rigid
 the markets that have started to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations
 furniture upholstery as just one example can easily take millions of pounds; foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer; and use of the foam for garment interlining is only now getting off the ground with volume potential in the offing
 urethane foams are basically reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates 
 blowing can be either one of two types- carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon
 the most important factor in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production
 originally the main types used were various compositions of polyesters
 these are still in wide use today particularly in semi-rigid formulations for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural panels foamed- in-place insulation automotive safety padding arm rests etc
 more recently polyethers- again in varied compositions molecular weights and branching- have come into use at first for the flexible foams just lately for the rigids
 the polyether glycols are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which is much desired in cushioning 6
 although the first polyether foams on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method today thanks to new catalysts they can be produced by a one-shot technique 7
 it is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours and with superior properties to latex foam
 the polyester urethane foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters; the polyether group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol one shot vs prepolymer the isocyanate and resin are mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs
 the foaming can be accomplished at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of catalyst in solution
 in one-shot the isocyanate polyester or polyether resin catalyst and other additives are mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately
 basically this means that simpler processing equipment and less external heat are required in one-shot foaming although at the same time the problems of controlling the conditions of one-shot foaming are critical ones
 most commercial uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lbcu ft for rigid foams between 1 and 3 lbcu ft for flexible foams
 this latter figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average of 5
 5 lbcu ft in commercial grades
 graph in fig 1 p 392 indicates how the ratio of compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or decreased 5
 the single curve line represents a specific formulation in a test example
 by varying the formula this curve may be moved forward or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression strengthdensity ratio
 in flexible urethane foams we are referring to the range between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials' primary performance remains functionally useful 7
 in temperature resistance this quality is usually related to specific properties eg flexural tensile strengths etc 6
 thermal conductivity is directly traceable to the material's porous air-cell construction which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which forms its composition
 these air or gas bubbles make highly functional thermal barriers 7
 the k factor a term used to denote the rate of heat transmission through a material ranges from 0
 28 for flexible urethane foams and from 0
 16 for rigid urethane foams depending upon the formulation density cell size and nature of blowing agents used
 table 1 p 394 shows a comparison of k factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating materials flexural this term refers to the ability of a material to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required to cause failure by bending
 the higher-density urethane semi-rigid foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance ie the 12 lbcu ft foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the 3 lbcu ft density
 note that flexural strength is not always improved by simply increasing the density nor is the change always proportional from one formulation to another
 where flexural strength is an important factor be sure that your urethane foam processor is aware of it
 this property refers to the greatest longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing apart 6
 like compression strength of urethane foams it has a direct relationship to formulation
 exceptional tensile strength is another of urethane foam's strong features
 figure 2 above shows t he aging properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change processing there are many ways of producing a foamed urethane product
 the foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape it can be molded it can be poured- in-place it can be applied by spray guns etc
 slab stock is still one of the most important forms of urethane end-product in use today
 basically the foam machines that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units a variable mixer a nozzle carriage assembly and in many cases a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidifies into foam 4
 the ingredients are fed from tanks through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate
 the mixing head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle
 it only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed and after a short cure the material can be cut into lengths as desired
 much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate the slab stock into finished products
 profile cutting machines are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce sine triangle trapezoid and other profiles in variable heights dimensions etc
 the convoluted sheets can be combined to attain certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically
 also available is a slitter which peels the inside of a folded block of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd in length down to 116 in thick
 the low cost and ease of fabrication of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide variety of shapes dimensions and contours that can be tailor-made to customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case liners materials handling containers packaging and cushioning devices and such novelties as soap dishes toys head rests arch supports and gas pedal covers 4
 although slab stock appeared first it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with irregular shapes crowned contours or rounded edges the cutting of slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process
 only by resorting to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the established cushion market
 the closed molding of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction of the material
 satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether foams were never fully achieved
 closed molding generally resulted in parts weighing more than parts fabricated from free-blown foams
 this counteracted the gain from having no scrap loss 8
 in addition there were difficulties with the flow and spreading of the foam mixture over the mold surface trouble with lack of gel strength in the rising foam and problems of splits 7
 the introduction of one-shot polyether foam systems aided by the development of new catalysts helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding
 while there are still many bugs to be ironed out the technique is fast developing
 simple systems are available that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured pumped etc into a void where they foam up to fill the void
 in a typical application- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels- an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top of the panel is locked in place by a jig
 temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85-90`f 
 the top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs
 sixty lbs loading is possible but 40 lbs is adequate 6
 the suds box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain pipe and the machine is started
 the 160-ml bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is applied slowly and directly to the running specimen 6
 washing is continued for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips or passes through the squeeze rolls 8
 at the conclusion of the washing 8 liters of water at 90`f are automatically metered from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs 4 liters to each tub
 this operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes 11
 during the rinsing operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow from the main drain begins
 at this point the drains are readjusted so that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain is set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge
 when all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs
 the run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line
 by this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages first by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water since soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly to waste from the suds box drains
 this method of rinsing appears to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition
 evaluation and classification evaluation may be made on either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired 5
 a reflectance-measuring instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning whereas soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal
 this test method is intended for determining the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics made of fibers other than wool to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home
 four washing test procedures are established varying in severity from very severe to very mild and are intended to cover the range of practical washing from commercial procedure to hand washing 6
 five drying test procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques used in the home and commercial laundry 7
 three methods for determining the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering 6
 these tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate dimensional changes after repeated launderings
 table 1 summarizes all of the various washing drying and restoration procedures available
 the person using these tests must determine which combination of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry 5
 it is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code consisting of a roman numeral a letter and an arabic number 10
 for example test 3 e 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed by procedure 3 in the machine has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure e and has been subjected to restorative forces on the tension presser by procedure 1
 a specimen or garment is washed in a cylindrical reversing wash wheel dried and subjected to restorative forces where necessary 7
 temperature and time of agitation in the wash wheel are varied to obtain different degrees of severity
 drying procedures and application of restorative force procedures are varied to conform with end-use handling during home or commercial laundering
 distances marked on the specimen in warp and filling directions are measured before and after laundering
 _wash wheel- the wheel is 20 to 24 inches inside diameter and 20 to 24 inches inside length
 there are three fins each approximately three inches wide extending the full length of the inside of the wheel
 one fin is located every 120` around the inside diameter of the wheel
 the wash wheel rotates at a speed of 30 revolutions per minute making five to ten revolutions before reversing
 the water inlets are large enough to permit filling the wheel to an eight-inch level in less than two minutes and the outlet is large enough to permit discharge of this same amount of water in less than two minutes
 the machine is equipped with a pipe for injecting live steam that is capable of raising the temperature of water at an eight-inch level from 110` to 140`f in less than two minutes
 the machine shall contain an opening for the insertion of a thermometer or other equivalent equipment for determining the temperature of the water during the washing and rinsing procedures 7
 it is equipped with an outside water gauge that will indicate the level of the water in the wheel
 a domestic automatic washer that will give equivalent results may be used
 the wash wheel is the pressing equipment- flat-bed any flat-bed press capable of pressing a specimen 22 inches square may be used as an alternative
 the flat-bed press is maintained at a temperature not less dryer- dryer of the rotary tumble type having a cylindrical basket approximately 30 inches in diameter the dryer is provided with a means of maintaining a drying temperature of 120`-160`f measured in the exhaust screen drying racks- 16-mesh screening
 drying room-facilities for drip- or line-drying
 extractor- centrifugal extractor of the laundry-type with a perforated basket approximately 11 inches deep by 17 inches in diameter with an operating speed of approximate ly 1500 rpm 6
 pen and ink indelible- or other suitable marking device 7
 soap neutral _softener- eg sodium metaphosphate or sodium hexametaphosphate 
 flatiron electric- approximately 3 lbtension presser- consisting of a padded ironing board two of the clamps are fixed to the edges of the board whereas two clamps travel on guide rails opposite the fixed clamps
 the movable clamps travel on carriages which ride the rails and are drawn by dead-weight loading
 sets of weights are provided so that the load can be selected in the range of 12 to 4 pounds
 a perforated aluminum plate used to provide the drying surface is heated by means of a flatiron
 a special template is furnished with the apparatus to enable marking a specimen for a central measuring area and the fabric extensions to the clamps knit shrinkage gauge- consisting of a set of 20 mounting each pin is individually sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in the slot
 the springs have an extension of 1 inch at f tension 9
 the tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane of the test specimen
 the minimum diameter of the pin frame in the collapsed state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the freely extended state is 14 inches
 the surface of the apparatus in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as to be as friction-free as possible 7
 the preparation of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional restorability procedure to be used 8
 three specimens for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory average of performance
 this is especially true for knitted fabric s
 specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with a standard atmosphere of f and f and then laid out without tension on a flat polished surface care being taken that the fabric is free from wrinkles or creases
 fabrics that are badly distorted in their unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional change results when laundered by any procedure
 this also holds true if restorative forces are applied 9
 therefore it is recommended that in such cases the sample be replaced or if used the results of dimensional change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative only
 generally it is necessary to mark distances on a specimen in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and to measure before and after laundering
 the distances may be marked with indelible ink and a fine-point pen by sewing fine threads into the fabric or by a specially designed stamping machine
 the marked distances are parallel to the respective yarns 9
 usually the greater the original distances marked the greater will be the accuracy of the woven fabrics to be dried by procedure b or restored by the specimen of fabric is a rectangle at least 22 by 22 inches except for cloth narrower than 22 inches in which case the specimen is the entire width of the fabric
 three distances each at least 18 inches are measured and marked off parallel to each of the warp and filling directions
 the distances are at woven or warp knitted each specimen is at least 25 inches by 25 inches
 place the template on the fabric so that the sides of the 10 inch square cut out of the template are parallel to the warp and filling for woven fabrics or the wales and courses for knitted fabrics and so that the same amount of fabric extends beyond the edges of the template on all sides
 mark the specimen at the outer edges of the template with pen and indelible ink; also place three dots on the specimen at each side of the 10 inch square one dot at midpoint and one at approximately circular knitted fabrics to be subjected to restorative procedure 2 each specimen is approximately 16 inches square
 the markings consist of a centrally located 10 inch diameter measuring circle and a 14 inch diameter circle of 20 dots equidistantly spaced 
 critical measurements in length and width directions should be taken before and after washing drying and restorative procedures 7
 the washing procedures are summarized in table 2 8
 place the specimen in the wash wheel with sufficient other similar fabric to make a dry load of f pounds
 start the wash wheel and note the time
 immediately add water at 100-105`f to the wheel to a level of f inches; this level will be increased by condensed steam 6
 when this water level has been reached inject steam into the wheel until the temperature reaches that shown in column b of table 2 5
 add sufficient soap to furnish a good running suds or if desired use a synthetic detergent
 stop the wash wheel at the end of the time shown in column a of table 2 and drain
 refill the machine to a level of f inches with water at 100-109` f and start the machine
 inject steam if necessary to reach the temperature shown in column d of table 2
 again stop the machine at the end of the time shown in column c of table 2
 this procedure is repeated for the second rinse using the temperatures tests 2 3 - run the machine continuously until completion of the test
 drain off the soap solution of the suds cycle at such a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of soap and water at the end of the time shown in column a of table 2 measured from the time the wash wheel was started
 refill the machine to a level of f inches with water at 100-109` f
 when this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature is that shown in column d
 drain off the water at such a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end of the sum of the times shown in columns a and c measured from the time the wash wheel was started 5
 immediately refill to a level of f inches with water at 100-109` f
 when this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature is that shown in column f
 drain off the water at such a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end of the sum of the times shown in columns a c and e measured from the time the wash wheel was started
 high-gain photoelectronic image intensification is applied under conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of practicabilit y
 examples of such situations are night reconnaissance the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues special radiography in medical or industrial applications track recording of high energy particles etc
 high-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieved by several methods; some of cascading single stages by coupling lens systems image intensifier based upon the multipactor transmission secondary electron multiplication cascading of single stages enclosed in one common envelope
 cascading single stages by coupling lens systems is rather inefficient as the lens systems limit the obtainable gain quite severely
 channel-type image intensifie rs are capable of achieving high-gain values; suffer however from an inherently low resolution 5
 image intensifiers based upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable resolution is concerned 7
 however the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts the effective gain
 tsem tubes have been constructed showing high gain and resolution
 however electrostatic focus important for many applications has not been realized for these devices
 resolution limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to chromatic aberrations
 furthermore the thin film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be tolerated 5
 cascaded single stages enclosed by a common envelope have been constructed with high gain and high resolution
 these tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the coupling members
 the electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one
 the magnification may be smaller equal or larger than unity 7
 an electrostatic system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen is utilized while a magnetic system requires accurate adjustment of the solenoid which is heavy and bulky 5
 as it will be discussed later peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing curved fiber couplers
 it should be noted however that the paraxial resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems
 it is felt that fiber-coupled double- stage image intensifiers will gain considerable importance in the future
 therefore we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities of such tubes
 the luminous efficiency and resolution of single stages fiber couplers and finally of the composite tube will be computed 5
 it will be shown theoretically that the high image intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits the utilization of extremely low incident light levels
 the effect of device and quantum noise associated with such low input levels will be described
 after these theoretical considerations constructional details of a fiber-coupled double-stage x-ray image intensifier will be discussed
 measured performance characteristics for this experimental tube will be listed
 the conclusion shall be reached that fiber-coupled double-stage tubes represent a sensible and practical approach to high-gain image intensification
 design of a fiber-coupled double-stage image intensifier the tube design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be described now
 the electron optical system is based in principle on the focusing action of concentric spherical cathode and anode surfaces 7
 the inner anode sphere is pierced elongated into a cup and terminated by the phosphor screen
 the photoelectrons emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused by the positive lens action of the two concentric spheres pass through the negative lens formed by the anode aperture and impinge upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen 6
 the cylindrical focusing electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the focusing potential
 the anode potential codetermines the gain g and magnification m of the stage
 both the photocathode and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved concave as seen from the anode aperture 6
 the field-flattening property of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or coupling member
 for the same reason the output fiber plate is planoconcave its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent record is desired
 as it will be shown later the field-flattening properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design
 the second photocathode and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates
 the photocathode sensitivities s phosphor efficiencies p and anode potentials v of the individual stages shall be distinguished by means of subscripts 1 and 2 in the text where required
 both stages are assumed to have unity magnification 7
 _flux gain of a single stage to a first approximation given by the product of the photocathode sensitivity s and the phosphor conversion efficiency p
 in general p is a function of v and the current density but it shall here be assumed as a constan t
 the luminous efficiency f of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant sensitivity f and on the spectral distribution of the incident light f by the relation: f where f h normalized radiant photocathode sensitivity
 f h standard visibility function
 the luminous flux gain of a single stage is given by: f if the input light distribution falls beyond the visible range f as expected since f
 such cases are not considered here
 the numerical aperture of the fibers is given by: f where f 9
 the angle f is measured in the medium of index f
 settled phosphors as generally used in image intensifiers have low optical contact with the substrate surface hence f shall be assumed 6
 the numerical aperture should be in general close to unity 9
 this condition can be satisfied eg with f and f or equivalent glass combinations
 a sufficiently good approximation for determining the end reflection losses r can be obtained from the angle independent fresnel formula: f for phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surfaces and assuming f we obtain f percent
 this value may be reduced to 4
 6 percent by means of a glass layer of index 1 7
 hence the f factor for the output fiber coupler is f 10
 as the index of refraction of photosensitive surfaces of the sbcs-type lies around 2 the fresnel losses at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0
 5 percent and the f factor for the interstage coupler is 0 9
 it might be anticipated that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further
 the internal losses are due to absorption and the small but finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to deviations from the prescribed cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfections of the core-jacket interface
 these losses depend on fiber diameter and length absorption coefficient the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last but not least on the angular distribution of the incident light 5
 explicit expressions are given in the literature 12
 lacking reliable data for some of the variables we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent internal losses for 14-inch long small diameter fibers
 this relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber diameters increasing the number of internal reflections 9
 since we are considering here relatively small diameter fiber plates their average thickness can be kept below 14 inch and their internal losses may be assumed as 15 percent
 the packing efficiency fr of fiber plates did not receive much attention in the literature probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally used until rather recently
 for circular fibers in a closely packed hexagonal array the packing efficiency is given by: f where f and 0
 906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the circumscribed hexagon
 for the small diameter fibers now technically feasible and required for about 100 f resolution f
 the cladding thickness is about 0
 5|m hence f and f
 thus the efficiency |t couplers is given by- f or approximately 50 percent each
 it must be remembered that the fiber plates replace a glass window and a membrane in addition to an optical output lens system 8
 the efficiency f of an f lens at the magnification f is: f neglecting absorption the end losses of the coupling membrane and the output window f would be 6 percent and 8 percent
 thus the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two fiber plates is 0
 043 or about gain of fiber including the brightness gain f due to the f area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber coupled double stage image intensifier is: f it is obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which maximizes f for a given input e is very important
 the same consideration should govern the choice of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate sensor
 we have evaluated the matching integrals for two types of photocathodes and three types of light input
 the input light distributions considered are p-11 and p- 20 phosphor emission and the so-called night light as given by hw babcock and j j johnson
 the integrals are listed in table 14-1 below: discussion of paraxial device resolution _resolution limitations the resolution limitations for a single stage are given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing screen
 the resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations 7
 it has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity magnification
 furthermore the chromatic aberrations depend on the chosen high voltage
 in general a high anode voltage reduces chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution
 the luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from eq for the 16 possible combinations of s-11 and s-20 photocathodes and p-11 and p-20 phosphor screens for night light and p-20 light input
 it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional x-ray 
 the following efficiencies obtained from jedec and rca specifications were used: f   the following table gain values computed according to eq with f:   the possibility of a space charge blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has been pointed out
 it is obvious that such an influence can only be expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output levels 9
 space charge influences will also decrease at increased voltages 6
 electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography
 a resolution of 70- 80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible
 the inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness decreases with decreasing porosity and might be impaired by the normally used aluminum mirror
 thus in general elementary light optical effects light scatter and electron scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit 7
 it should be noted that photoluminescence due to bremsstrahlung generated within the viewing screen by electron impact appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess of 30 kv are utilized 10
 it has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 f at high voltage values of approximately 20 kv
 for the further discussion we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 f and phosphor screen resolution of 60 f 7
 the set of all decisions is called the operating policy or more simply the policy
 an optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product 10
 there are thus three components to an optimal design problem: the specification of the operating variables and the transformation the specification of the objective function of which the optimization is desired
 for a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical species and the temperature or pressure of the stream
 for the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling to be supplied; the way in which the transformation of state depends on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed in the next chapter
 the objective function is some measure of the increase in value of the stream by processing; it is the subject of chapter 4 8
 the essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages with no feedback was first isolated by bellman
 he recognized that whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an r-stage process the remaining stages must use an optimal f-stage policy with respect to the state resulting from the first stage if there is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process
 moreover by systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and always using the optimal f-stage policy for the remaining stages we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r stages
 proceeding in this way from one to two and from two to three stages we may gradually build up the policy for any number
 at each step of the calculation the operating variables of only one stage need be varied
 to see how important this economy is let us suppose that there are m operating variables at each stage and that the state is specified by n variables; then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operations of order f  7
 to proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed states must be investigated to allow of interpolation; this number will be of the order of f
 if however we are seeking the optimal r-stage policy for a given feed state only one search for a maximum is required at the final step 7
 thus a number of operations of the order of f are required 12
 if all the operating variables were varied simultaneously f operations would be required to do the same job and as r increases this increases very much more rapidly than the number of operations required by the dynamic program
 but even more important than this is the fact that the direct search by simultaneously varying all operating conditions has produced only one optimal policy namely that for the given feed state and r stages
 in contrast the dynamic program produces this policy and a whole family of policies for any smaller number of stages 8
 if the problem is enlarged to require a complete coverage of feed states f operations are needed by the dynamic program and f by the direct search
 but f is vastly larg er than r
 no optimism is more baseless than that which believes that the high speed of modern digital computers allows for use of the crudest of methods in searching out a result
 suppose that f and that the average operation requires only f sec
 then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennia!   the principle of optimality thus brings a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process
 bellman has annunciated in the following terms:   an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state resulting from the first decision 6
 this is the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation
 it appears in a form that is admirably suited to the powers of the digital computer
 at the same time every device that can be employed to reduce the number of variables is of the greatest value and it is one of the attractive features of dynamic programming that room is left for ingenuity in using the special features of the problem to this end 7
 the discrete deterministic process consider the process illustrated in fig 2
 1 consisting of r distinct stages
 these will be numbered in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream so that stage r is the rth stage from the end 6
 let the state of the stream leaving stage r be denoted by a vector f and the operating variables of stage r by f
 thus f denotes the state of the feed to the r-stage process and f the state of the product from the last stage
 each stage transforms the state f of its feed to the state f in a way that depends on the operating variables f
 this transformation is uniquely determined by f and we therefore speak of the process as deterministic
 in practical situations there will be restrictions on the admissible operating conditions and we regard the vectors as belonging to a fixed and bounded set s
 the set of vectors f constitutes the operating policy or more briefly the policy and a policy is admissible if all the f belong to s
 when the policy has been chosen the state of the product can be obtained from the state of the feed by repeated application of the transformation; thus f
 the objective function which is to be maximized is some function usually piecewise continuous of the product state
 let this be denoted by f
 an optimal policy is an admissible policy f which maximizes the objective function p
 the policy may not be unique but the maximum value of p certainly is and once the policy is specified this maximum can be calculated by as a function of the feed state f
 let f where the maximization is over all admissible policies f
 when it is necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy is an optimal r-stage policy with respect to the feed state f 8
 for any choice of admissible policy f in the first stage the state of the stream leaving this stage is given by f
 this is the feed state of the subsequent f stages which according to the principle of optimality must use an optimal f-stage policy with respect to this state
 this will result in a value f of the objective function and when f is chosen correctly this will give f the maximum of the objective function
 thus f where the maximization is over all admissible policies f and f is related to f by can be solved for f when f is known and clearly f the maximization being over all admissible f
 the set of equations and the starting equation is of a recursive type well suited to programming on the digital computer 7
 in finding the optimal r-stage policy from that of f stages only the function f is needed
 when f has been found it may be transferred into the storage location of f and the whole calculation repeated
 we also see how the results may be presented although if n the number of state variables is large any tabulation will become cumbersome
 a table or set of tables may be set out as in table 2 8
 to extract the optimal r-stage policy with respect to the feed state f we enter section r of this table at the state f and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function
 in the third column is given the optimal policy for stage r and in the fourth the resulting state of the stream when this policy is used
 since by the principle of optimality the remaining stages use an optimal f-stage policy with respect to f we may enter section f of the table at this state f and read off the optimal policy for stage f and the resulting state f
 proceeding in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and if it is desired we can check on f by evaluating f at the last stage
 it may be that the objective function depends not only on f but also on f as when the cost of the operating policy is considered 7
 a moment's reflection shows that the above algorithm and presentation work equally well in this case
 a form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider is f
 here v represents the the cost of operating the stage with conditions 
 hence p is the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that is the net profit
 if f denotes the net profit from stage r and f then the principle of optimality gives f this sequence of equations may be started with the remark that with no process f there is no profit ie f
 the process in which the outcome of any one stage is known only statistically is also of interest although for chemical reactor design it is not as important as the deterministic process 7
 in this case the stage r operating with conditions f transforms the state of the stream from f to f but only the probability distribution of f is known
 this is specified by a distribution function f such that the probability that f lies in some region d of the stage space is f 6
 we cannot now speak of maximizing the value of the objective function since this function is now known only in a probabilistic sense
 we can however maximize its expected value
 for a single stage we may define f where the maximization is by choice of f
 we thus have an optimal policy which maximizes the expected value of the objective function for a given f
 if we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage is known before passage to the next then the principle of optimality shows that the policy in subsequent stages should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first
 then f the maximization being over all admissible f and the integration over the whole of stage space
 the type of presentation of results used in the deterministic process may be used here except that now the fourth column is redundant
 the third column gives the optimal policy but we must wait to see the outcome of stage r and enter the preceding section of the table at this state
 the discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage is not known before passing to the next is a very much more difficult matter
 in many cases it is not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stages since the state of the stream is transformed in a continuous manner through the process 6
 we replace r the number of the stage from the end of the process by t a continuous variable which measures the distance of the point considered from the end of the process
 the word distance is used here in a rather general sense; it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process
 if t is the total length of the process its feed state may be denoted by a vector  and the product state by  denotes the state at any point t and  the vector of operating variables there 7
 a gyro-stabilized platform system using restrained gyros is well suited for automatic leveling because of the characteristics of the gyro-platform-servo combination
 the restrained gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristics operates with an approximate equation of motion neglecting transient effects as follows: f where u is a torque applied about the output axis of the controlling gyro 6
 the platform angle |f is the angle about which the gyro is controlling
 this is normally termed the gyro input axis 90` away from the gyro output or |j axis
 the gyro angular momentum is defined by h
 thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintains the platform with zero angular deviation about the |f axis the system can be rotated with an angular velocity f if a torque is supplied to the gyro output axis |j
 it is assumed that the gyros are designed with electrical torquers so that a torque can be applied about their output axes 8
 in the system shown in fig 7-1 the accelerometer output is amplified and the resulting voltage is applied to the gyro output-axis torquer
 this torque causes the entire system to rotate about the |f axis since the response to f
 if the polarities are correct the platform rotates in such a direction as to reduce the accelerometer output to zero 9
 as the accelerometer output is decreasing the torque applied to the gyro output axis decreases and therefore the rate decreases 6
 finally when the accelerometer output is zero the entire system remains stationary and the platform is by definition leveled 7
 a mathematical block diagram for the leveling system is shown in fig 7- 2
 the platform is initially off level by the angle |f 9
 the angle generated by the platform servo |f multiplied by g is the effective acceleration acting on the accelerometer
 f is the scale factor of the accelerometer
 the voltage f is amplified by f and applied to the gyro torquer with scale factor f
 finally the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic is represented by f the system as indicated in fig 7-2 is fundamental and simple because the transient effects of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have been neglected
 with these factors included an upper limit is placed on the allowable loop gain by stability considerations
 in this type of system a high loop gain is desirable because it provides a fast response time
 when the frequency response characteristics of practical components are considered their effect on stability does not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain
 the time required for the system to reach a level position is approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain 8
 in addition the cutoff frequency for input accelerations is approximately proportional to the servo loop gain; ie high loop gain causes the system to respond to horizontal components of accelerations 5
 this problem usually determines the lower limit of loop gain rather than response time
 it must be noticed in fig 7-1 that the accelerometer responds to any input acceleration
 the equation relating input acceleration to output platform angle is f in practice the preflight leveling process takes place with the system mounted in the airframe
 when the system is arranged for automatic leveling the platform angles respond to any horizontal components of acceleration acting on the accelerometers
 there are many such components of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gusts engine noise turbulence around the vehicle etc 11
 one of the greatest problems associated with automatic leveling is establishing a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration noise
 one solution to the problem is to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filters
 this technique causes the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration components such as the platform tilt
 since a lower loop gain and low-pass filtering increases the response time a practical compromise must be reached
 one of the most desirable solutions is achieved by the use of a non-linear amplifier for f
 the amplifier is designed so that its gain is large for accelerometer signals above a certain threshold level 7
 below this level the amplifier gain f is proportional and is of small value in order to provide adequate noise filtering 5
 the effect is that the platform returns from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it is nearly level at which point the platform is controlled by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise has little effect on the leveling process 6
 when the system is on automatic leveling the gyro drift is canceled by the output of the leveling system
 the platform actually tilts off level so that the accelerometer output when amplified by f will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift
 the amount of platform dip required depends upon the scale factors of the system
 the automatic leveling system described in this section is readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consisting of three integrating gyros
 the system requires some switching of flight equipment circuits 9
 however the leveling operation can be maintained and controlled remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform 8
 this leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically as long as the system is actuated
 a useful by-product of this system is that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biases is available from the currents necessary to hold the system in level
 the leveling process can be accomplished manually and the results are as satisfactory as those obtained with automatic equipment 6
 the process consists in turning the platform manually until the outputs of both accelerometers are zero
 the turning is accomplished by applying voltage to the gyro torquers described above
 in brief the human replaces amplifier f in figs 7-1 and 7- 2 10
 manual leveling requires an appropriate display of the accelerometer outputs
 if high accuracy is required in preflight leveling it is usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer outputs 
 with integration the effect of a small acceleration can be seen after a time
 however skill is required on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy
 also it requires more time as compared to the automatic approach
 manual leveling is inconvenient if the platform must be maintained accurately level for any prolonged period of time 6
 the operator must continually supply the correct amount of turning current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift is canceled
 this process is especially difficult since gyro drifting is typically random
 platform heading consists of orienting the sensitive axis of the accelerometers parallel to the desired coordinate system of the navigator
 in simpler terms it amounts to pointing the platform in the proper direction
 for purely inertial navigators two techniques are available to accomplish the platform heading:  use of external or surveying equipment to establish proper heading
 use of the characteristics of the platform components for an indication of true heading the choice of the heading technique is dependent upon the accuracy requirements field conditions and the time available to accomplish the heading
 with the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be headed in the proper direction by using surveying techniques
 the platform accelerometers must be slightly modified for this procedure
 before the accelerometers are mounted on the platform the direction of their sensitive axis must be accurately determined 5
 a mirror is mounted on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror is perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit 8
 a precision transit is set up so that it is aligned with respect to true north
 this can be done to a high degree of accuracy by existing surveying techniques
 with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometers is sighted and the platform is turned until it is aligned
 the sighting procedure includes the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light which is darkened by crossed hairs on the accelerometer mirror
 when the platform is aligned the reflected image of the crossed hairs can be seen exactly superimposed upon the original crossed hairs 6
 the images can easily be aligned with a high degree of accuracy
 the platform is turned as required by supplying currents to the appropriate gyro torquers
 although this technique is simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty does exist: the direction of true north must be known for each launch point
 however this difficulty is not too serious if it is realized that a surveying team can establish a true north base line with a few days' work
 in many installations the inertial platform is raised off the ground a considerable height when it is mounted in the vehicle before flight
 with this situation it is difficult to sight in on the platform with surveying equipment
 if the platform is not too high off the ground a transit can be mounted on a stand to raise it up to the platform
 obviously the heading accuracy is lessened by such techniques since errors are introduced because of motion of the stand 5
 the transit can be replaced by an autocollimator
 this instrument provides an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviations of the platform and can be used to automatically hold the platform on true heading
 the electrical signal from the autocollimator is amplified and supplied to the z-gyro torquer
 if the polarity is correct the platform will turn until the heading error angle is zero
 information is also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the z-axis gyro
 if the z gyro is drifting a current generated by the autocollimator is delivered to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift 6
 if the drift error is systematic it can be canceled with a bias circuit which can be arranged and adjusted to supply the required compensating current
 it is possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which will indicate the angular deviation between the true heading direction and the platform
 essentially the stator or reference portion of the pickoff is established with respect to the true heading direction and the platform is turned either manually or automatically until the angular electrical pickoff signal is reduced to zero
 gyrocompass alignment is an automatic heading system which depends upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true heading 5
 for the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consisting of three restrained gyros a coordinate system is used where the sensitive axis of the x accelerometer is parallel to the east-west direction at the base point and the y accelerometer sensitive axis is parallel to the north-south direction at the base point
 the accelerometers are mounted rigidly on the platform 7
 thus if one accelerometer is properly aligned the other is also 10
 the input axis of the appropriate gyros are parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometers
 figure 7-3 shows a platform system with the gyro vectors arranged as described above
 the platform is leveled and properly headed so that the x-gyro input axis is parallel to the east-west direction and the y-gyro input axis is parallel to the north-south direction
 the input axis of the x gyro when pointing in the east-west direction is always perpendicular to the spin axis of earth 7
 if the platform is not properly headed the x-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth's rotation
 the sensing of this rotation by the x gyro can be utilized to direct the platform into proper heading
 in fig 7-4 the input axis of the three-axis platform is shown at some point on the earth
 the point is at a latitude |l and the platform is at an error in heading east
 the earth is spinning at an angular velocity \q equal to one revolution per 24 hr
 when the platform is level |e is a rotation about the z axis o f the platform f
 since the earth is rotating and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform is fixed with respect to a reference in space an observer on the earth will see the platform rotating
 scotty did not go back to school
 his parents talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor and to a specialist at the university hospital- mr mckinley was entitled to a discount for members of his family- and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder of the term off spend a lot of time in bed and for the rest do pretty much as he chose- provided of course he chose to do nothing too exciting or too debilitating 6
 his teacher and his school principal were conferred with and everyone agreed that if he kept up with a certain amount of work at home there was little danger of his losing a term
 scotty accepted the decision with indifference and did not enter the arguments
 he was discharged from the hospital after a two-day checkup and he and his parents had what mr mckinley described as a celebration lunch at the cafeteria on the campus
 rachel wore a smart hat and because she had been warned recently about smoking puffed at her cigarettes through a long ivory holder stained with lipstick
 scotty's father sat sprawled in his chair angular alert as a cricket looking about at the huge stainless-steel appointments of the room with an expression of proprietorship
 teachers- men who wore brown suits and had gray hair and pleasant smiles- came to their table to talk shop and to be introduced to scotty and rachel
 rachel was polite scotty indifferent
 they ate the cafeteria food with its orange sauces and scotty gazed without interest at his food the teachers the heroic baronial windows and the bright ranks of college banners
 his father tried to make the food a topic
 the blueberry pie is good scotty
 he looked at his son his face worried
 scotty murmured no thanks so softly his father had to bend his gaunt height across the table and turn a round brown ear to him 5
 scotty regarded the ear and the grizzled hair around it with a moment of interest
 he said more loudly i'm full old pop
 he had eaten almost nothing on the crested three-sectioned plate and had drunk about half the milk in its paper container 6
 he's all right craig rachel said
 i can fix him something later in the afternoon when we get home
 since his seizure scotty had had little appetite; yet his changed appearance surprisingly was one of plumpness
 his face was fuller; his lips and the usually sharp lines of his jaw had become swollen-looking
 he breathed now with his mouth open showing a whitely curving section of lower teeth; he kept his eyes with their puffed blurred lids always lowered though not apparently focusing
 even his neck seemed thicker and therefore shorter 11
 his hands which had been as quick as a pair of fluttering birds were now neither active nor really relaxed
 they lay on his lap palms up stiffly motionless the tapered fingers a little thick at the joints
 altogether he had since the seizure the appearance of a boy who overindulged in food and took no exercise
 he looked lazy spoiled a little querulous
 rachel had little to say
 she greeted her husband's colleagues with smiling politeness offering nothing
 mr mckinley for all his sprawling and his easy familiarity was completely alert to his son eyes always on the still face jumping to anticipate scotty's desires
 it was a strained silent lunch
 rachel said i'd better get him to bed
 the doctors had suggested scotty remain most of every afternoon in bed until he was stronger
 since mr mckinley had to give a lecture rachel and scotty drove home alone in the plymouth
 they did not speak much
 scotty gazed out at ugly gray slums and said softly look at those stupid kids
 it was a negro section of peeling row houses store-front churches and ragged children
 rachel had to bend toward scotty and ask him to repeat 6
 and then: there are lots of kids around here 11
 scotty looked at the children his mouth slightly opened his eyes dull
 he felt tired and full and calm
 the days seemed short perhaps because his routine was each day almost the same
 he rose late and went down in his bathrobe and slippers to have breakfast either alone or with rachel
 virginia treated him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite with special food: biscuits cookies candies- the result of devoted hours in the tiled kitchen
 she would hover over him and looking like her brother anxiously watch the progress of scotty's fork or spoon
 you don't eat enough honey
 try to get that down
 rachel observing would say he has to rediscover his own capacity 8
 virginia and rachel talked to each other quietly now as allies who are political rather than natural might in a war atmosphere 7
 both watched scotty constantly rachel without seeming to virginia openly her eyes filled with concern
 he did not resent their supervision or virginia's sometimes tiring sympathy
 he ate what he felt like slept as much or as little as he pleased and moved about the draughty rooms of the house when he was not in bed with slow dubious steps like an elderly tourist in a cathedral 5
 he was able now to sit for hours in a chair in the living room and stare out at the bleak yard without moving
 his hands lay loosely yet stiffly- they were like wax hands: almost lifelike not quite- folded in his lap; his mouth hung slightly open
 when he was asked a question or addressed in such a way that some response was inescapable he would answer; if as often happened he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly he would repeat his words in the same way without emphasis or impatience only a little louder 8
 he had not mentioned kate
 he had not even thought about her much except once or twice at night in bed when his slowly ranging thoughts would abruptly almost accidentally encounter her
 at these times he felt a kind of pain in his upper chest but it was an objective pain in no way different from others in intensity and not different in kind; it was like the bandaged wound on the back of his head which occasionally throbbed; it was merely another part of his weakness
 he was calm drugged and lazy
 rachel mentioned kate
 she said i notice the girl from across the street hasn't bothered to phone or visit
 scotty said that's all right
 he thought about it briefly then deliberately turned the talk to something else
 once sitting at the front window in his parents' room he saw kate come out of her house
 they were far off and looked tiny
 the heavy branches in his front yard would hide and then reveal them
 they turned at the bottom of kate's steps and moved off in the direction of the park
 he thought he saw- it awakened and for a moment interested him- that elizabeth held a leash in her hand and that a round fuzzy puppy was on the end of the leash
 then they disappeared and scotty got up and went into his own room and got into bed
 by the time he was under the covers he had forgotten about seeing kate
 the doctor since scotty was no longer allowed to make his regular trips into town to see him came often and informally to the house 7
 he would sit slim-waisted and spare on the edge of scotty's bed his legs crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot could tap the floor
 scotty did not mind the doctor's unsmiling teasing as he used to 8
 husky young man he said with mock distaste
 i imagine you're always battling in school
 i don't go to school any more
 pardon? 19
  the doctor had to bend close to hear; his delicate hand as veined as a moth's wing rested absently on scotty's chest 4
 scotty said the same words more loudly
 well we're taking a little vacation that's all
 he turned unsmilingly to rachel
 i think by the end of next week he could get out in the air a little
 he could now but the weakness is very definite; it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily
 his stethoscope was on the table by scotty's bed and he picked it up and wagged it at scotty
 he said fussily just keep the cap on those strong emotions 12
 the stethoscope glinted silver in the darkening room 8
 i'll drop by again in a few days
 rachel stayed on after the doctor had gone
 she smoothed the covers on scotty's bed and picked things up from the floor
 she did not touch him
 he did not speak
 he had no desire to
 she said do you think you'll miss school? 16
    he had noticed how formal and irritably exact rachel had grown 6
 he felt her irritability did not concern him yet he knew he would not care even if it did
 we've had any number of calls about you
 you could win a popularity contest at that school without any trouble
 she wants to pay you a visit
 she says the children miss you
 apparently you were the light of their lives
 rachel came close to the bed bent as if she would kiss him then moved away
 that doctor annoys me
 she seemed to speak to herself
 do you suppose his self-consciousness is characteristic of the new negro professionals or merely of doctors in general? 8
    she turned to him again
 well mrs charles- sally- has phoned too
 rachel's tone was dry
 she didn't really say- she glanced away at the floor then swooped gracefully and picked up one of scotty's slippers 5
 i mean do you feel like seeing kate? 13
  scotty said i don't know
 he did not
 there was the slight pain but it was no different from the throbbing in his head
 well there's time in any case
 we'll wait till you're stronger and then talk about it 4
 she put the slipper neatly by its mate at the foot of the bed
 this time rachel kissed him lightly on the forehead 9
 his father was a constant visitor
 scotty would hear the front door in the evening and then his father's deep slow voice; it floated up the stairs
 how's scotty? 15
  and rachel's or virginia's reply: better
 he's getting plenty of rest
 is his appetite improved? 14
  or: does he get exercise? 10
    the exchange was almost invariable and scotty in his bed could hear every word of it
 it required an energy he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father
 his father would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot of the bed and look at his son
 after a pause during which he studied scotty's face as if scotty were not there and could not study him too mr mckinley would ask the same questions he had asked downstairs
 scotty would reply softly and his father apologetically would ask him to repeat
 i'm eating more he would say
 or: i walk around the house a lot
 perhaps you should get out a little
 i'm not supposed to yet
 he did not mind the useless kindly questions 18
 he looked at the lined face with vague interest; he felt he was noting it as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger
 mr mckinley examined everything with critical care seeking something material to blame for his son's illness
 have you got enough blankets? 17
  and another time without accusation: you never wore that scarf i bought you
 where their sharp edges seemed restless as sea waves thrusting themselves upward in angry motion papa-san sat glacier-like his smooth solidity his very immobility defying all the turmoil about him 4
 our objective the colonel had said that day of the briefing is papa-san
 there the objective sat brooding over all
 gouge burn blast insult it as they would could anyone really take papa-san? 7
  between the ponderous hulk and himself in the valley over which papa-san reigned men had hidden high explosives booby traps and mines
 the raped valley was a pregnant womb awaiting abortion 9
 on the forward slope in front of his own post stretched two rows of barbed wire
 at the slope's base coils of concertina stretched out of eye range like a wild tangle of children's hoops stopped simultaneously weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic of the child's touch to start them all rolling again
 closer still regular barricades of barbed wire hung on timber supports
 was it all vain labor? 17
  who would clean up the mess when the war was over? 9
  smiling at his quixotic thoughts warren turned back from the opening and lit a cigarette before sitting down
 tonight a group of men tomorrow night he himself would go out there somewhere and wait
 if he were to go with white he would be out there two days not just listening in the dark at some point between here and papa-san but moving ever deeper into enemy land- behind papa-san itself 8
 was this what he had expected? 9
  he hadn't realized that there would be so much time to think so many lulls
 somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told that combat was an intermittent activity
 now he knew that the moment illuminated by the vision on the train would have to be approached
 it could take place tomorrow night or it might occur months from now
 there was just too much time
 white's suggestion flattered but he did not like the identity 8
 he did not spill over with hatred for the enemy
 he hadn't even seen him yet h   pressing his cigarette out in the earth warren walked to the slit and scanned the jagged hills 7
 he saw no life but still stood there for a time peering at the unlovely hills his gaze continually returning to papa-san 7
 he had come here in order to test himself
 while most of his beliefs were still unsettled he knew that he did not believe in killing
 he had come because he could not live out his life feeling that he had been a coward
 there were ten men on the patrol which sergeant prevot led out that next night
 the beaming rok was carrying a thirty-caliber machine gun; another man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition
 warren and white each carried in addition to their own weapons and ammo a box of ammo for the rok's machine gun
 others carried extra clips for the browning automatic rifle which was in the hands of a little mexican named martinez 8
 prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon
 we just sit quiet and wait prevot had said
 be sure the man nearest you is awake
 if joe doesn't show up we'll all be back here at 0600 hours 7
 otherwise we hold a reception
 then we pull out under our mortar and artillery cover but nobody pulls out until i say so
 remember what i said about going out to get anybody left behind? 8
  that still holds
 we bring back all dead and wounded
 at 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the point of departure
 then began the journey through their own mine fields 9
 ours were kinder than theirs some said
 they set bouncing betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully had them go off at the head
 the crude wooden boxes of the enemy our nicely turned gray metal disks
 but theirs defied the detectors
 a foot misplaced a leg missing
 all sizes: big ones some wired to set off a whole field little ones hand grenade size
 booby traps to fill the head with chunks of metal 7
 warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by looking at the sky
 prevot had said that the searchlights would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours which gives us time to get settled in position 5
 because they were new men and to be sure that they didn't get lost prevot had placed warren and white in the center of the patrol as it filed out
 his eyes now fixed on white's solid figure warren could hear behind him the tread of another
 he could also hear the stream which he had seen from his position
 they were going to follow it for part of their journey 14
 it's safe prevot had said and it provides cover for our noise 4
 soon they were picking their way along the edge of the stream which glowed in the night
 on their right rose the embankment covered with brush and trees
 if a branch extended out too far each man held it back for the next and if they met a low overhang each warned the other 6
 thus stealthily they advanced upstream; then they turned to the right climbed the embankment and walked into the valley again 8
 there was no cover here only grass sighing against pant-legs 14
 and with each sigh like a whip in the hand of an expert the grass stripped something from warren
 the gentle whir of each footstep left him more naked than before until he felt his unprotected flesh tremble chilled by each new sound
 the shapes of the men ahead of him lacked solidity as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh
 the dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords
 the warped broken trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes
 clumps of brush that they passed were so many enchained demons straining in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones
 looming over all papa-san leered down at him threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies
 off in the distance a searchlight flashed on its beam slashing the sky
 the sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud then reflected to the earth in a softer diffused radiance
 somewhere over there another patrol had need of light 8
 warren thought of all the men out that night who like himself had left their protective ridge and- fear working at their guts- picked their way into the area beyond
 from the east to the west coast of the korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound or shouting amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts
 white's arm went up and warren raised his own
 prevot came up take that spot over there he whispered pointing to a small clump of blackness
 give me your machine gun ammo
 warren handed him the metal box and prevot quietly disappeared down the line
 lying in the grass behind the brush clump warren looked about 8
 the others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and the brush
 over his shoulder he could see prevot with the machine gun crew 9
 even at this short distance they were only vague shapes setting up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the heads of the rest of the patrol
 warren eased his rifle's safety off and gently slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with an x
 this he placed within quick reach
 the walk and his fears had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch of the night air
 although the armored vest fitted the upper part of his body snugly he felt no security
 figures seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched
 certain this menace was only imaginary he yet stared in fascinated horror his hand sticky against the stock of his weapon 5
 he was aware of insistent inner beatings as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body
 above the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light 5
 then the figures which held his attention became a group of shattered trees standing like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene
 even so he could not ease the tension of his body; the rough surface of the earth itself seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax
 sensing the unseen presence of the other men in the patrol he felt mutely united to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him
 he sensed something precious in the perilous moment something akin to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the french countryside a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness
 in france he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown up to the sky and always as he wandered he felt a stranger to their exultation
 they were poems in a strange language of which he could barely touch a meaning- enough to make his being ache with the desire for the fullness he sensed there
 brittany that stone-gray mystery through which he traveled for thirty days sleeping in the barns of farmers or alongside roads had worked some subtle change in him he knew and it was in brittany that he had met pierre
 pierre had no hands; they had been severed at the wrists 6
 with leather cups fitted in his handlebars he steered his bicycle
 he and warren had traveled together for four days 10
 they visited the shipyards at brest and pierre had to sign the register vouching for the integrity of the visiting foreigner 7
 he took the pen in his stumps and began to write 9
 wait! wait! cried the guard who ran from the hut to shout to other men standing about outside
 they crowded the small room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless man write his name in the book
 c'est merveilleux
 and then the questions came eager interested questions and many compliments on his having overcome his infirmity
 doesn't it ever bother you warren had asked to have people always asking you about your hands? 6
    oh the french are a very curious people pierre had laughed 7
 they are also honest seekers after truth
 now the english are painfully silent about my missing hands 8
 they refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there 11
 the americans like yourself take the fact for granted try to be helpful but don't ask questions
 i'm used to all three but i think the french have the healthiest attitude
 that was the day that pierre had told warren about the abbey of solesmes
 you are looking tired and there you can rest
 it will be good for you
 i think too he said his dark eyes mischievous that you will find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you have spoken
 within two weeks warren was ringing the bell at the abbey gate 7
 the monk who opened the door immediately calmed his worries about his reception: i speak english the old man said but i do not hear it very well
 he smiled and stuck a large finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that might help
 smiling at warren's protestations the old monk took his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor
 will you please wait in here
 mickie sat over his second whisky- on-the-rocks in a little bar next to the funeral parlor on pennsylvania avenue
 al's little cafe was small dark narrow and filled with the mingled scent of beer tobacco smoke and italian cooking
 hanging over the bar was an oil painting of a nude al had accepted from a student at the corcoran gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke
 the nude was small and black-haired and elfin and was called eloise
 this was one place where moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without anyone noticing him or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the low-down
 the other patrons were taxi drivers and art students and small shopkeepers
 the reporters had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway 11
 his friend jane was with him
 she was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even if he did weigh too much and didn't own the mint
 she was the widow of a writer who had died in an airplane crash and mickie had found her a job as head of the historical section of the treasury
 this meant sorting out press clippings and the like 8
 jane sat receptive and interested
 mickie had a pleasant glow as he said you see both of them i mean the president and jeff lawrence are romantics
 a romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and all he has to do is find the right key and then divine justice and altruism will appear
 it's like focusing a camera; the distant ship isn't there until you get the focus
 you know what i'm talking about
 i'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live with them
 but when it comes to war the colonel knows what it is and jeff doesn't
 mr christiansen knows that a soldier will get the distinguished service medal for conduct that would land him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian
 he had a mean unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit and someone invented the name trig for him
 that's to say he was trigger happy
 he'd shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry
 he was a wiry inscrutable silent country boy from the red clay of rural alabama and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally make fun of
 but not in front of trig
 i heard of some that tried it back in the states and he'd knock them clear across the room
 there'd been a pretty bad incident back at the marine base 6
 a new york kid a refugee from one of the harlem gangs made fun of trig's accent and drew a knife
 before the fight was over the harlem boy had a concussion and trig was cut up badly
 they caught trig stealing liquor from the officers' mess and he got a couple of girls in trouble
 the fear of punishment just didn't bother him 10
 it was left out of him at birth
 this is why he made such a magnificent soldier
 he wasn't troubled with the ordinary rank-and-file fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers and whole companies under fire running in panic
 it just didn't occur to trig that anything serious would happen to him
 do you get the picture of the kind of fellow he was? 15
    jane nodded with a pleasant smile
 there was a sniper's nest in a mountain cave and it was picking off our men with devilish accuracy
 the colonel ordered that it be wiped out and i suggested 'you ask for volunteers and promise each man on the patrol a quart of whisky ten dollars and a week-end pass to davao'
 trig was one of the five volunteers
 the patrol snaked around in back of the cave approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls
 you could hear them from our outpost
 there was a lot of shooting
 we knew the enemy was subdued because a flare was fired as the signal
 two of our men were killed a third was wounded
 trig and a very black colored boy from detroit had killed or put out of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand- to-hand fighting 6
 when we got there trig and the negro were quarreling over possession of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded filipino 5
 the colored boy had it and trig lunged at him with a knife and said 'give that to me you black bastard
 we don't 'low nigras to walk on the same sidewalk with white men where i come from'
 the negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound 7
 what did the colonel do about the men? 7
  jane asked in her placid interested way
 he recommended both of them for the dsm and the detroit fellow for the purple heart too for a combat-inflicted wound
 so you see mr christiansen knows what it's all about 12
 when he was in the war he was in law or supplies or something like that and an old buddy of his told me he would come down on sundays to the pentagon and read the citations for medals- just like the one we sent in for trig- and go away with a real glow
 these were heroes nine feet tall to him
 jefferson lawrence was alone at the small perfectly appointed table by the window looking out over the river
 he had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a serpent with two heads
 open beside him was mrs dalloway
 he thought how this dainty fragile older woman threading her way through the streets of westminster on a day in june enjoying the flowers in the shops the greetings from old friends but never really drawing a deep passionate breath was so like himself
 he and mrs dalloway too had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the bone marrow of the spirit 6
 he had not because he was both poor and ambitious 17
 poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious 7
 they cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars along a dark country lane
 no they must look the other way and climb one more painful step up the ladder
 he made the decision with his eyes open or so he thought 11
 at any cost he must leave the dreary pennsylvania mining town where his father was a pharmacist
 and so he had so he had
 at state college he had no time to walk among the violets on the water's edge
 from his room he could look out in springtime and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly deliciously across the campus and he could smell the sweet vernal winds
 he was not unmoved
 he had to teach himself patiently that these traps were not for him
 he must mentally pull the blinds and close the window so that all that existed was in the books before him
 at law school the same
 more of this stamping down of human emotion as a young lawyer in new york
 by the time he was prosperous enough- his goals were high- he was bald and afraid of women
 the only one who would have him was his cripple the strange unhappy woman who became his wife
 perhaps it was right; perhaps it was just
 he had dared to defy nature to turn his back to the lorelei and he was punished
 like mrs dalloway with her regrets about peter walsh he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent
 if he had had a son he would tell him gather ye rosebuds while ye may h this same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying 5
 but then his son could afford it
 lawrence was waiting for bill boxell
 the vice president had called and asked if he could see the secretary at his home
 he said the matter was urgent
 the secretary was uneasy about the visit
 he did not like boxell
 he suspected something underhanded and furtive about him 12
 lawrence could not put his finger on it precisely and this worried him
 when you disliked or distrusted a man you should have a reason 13
 human nature was not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell
 lawrence stared a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic hoping that a clue to his dislike of the vice president would appear 7
 therefore he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with his point of view 5
 a half hour later the vice president arrived 14
 he looked very carefully at every piece of furnishing as though hoping to store this information carefully in his mind
 he observed the florentine vase in the hall the renoir painting in the library as well as the long shelves of well-bound volumes; the pattern of the oriental rug the delicate cut-glass chandelier 7
 he said to the secretary i understand you came from a little pennsylvania town near wilkes-barre
 how did you find out about this? 13
  he waved his arm around at the furnishings
 it was not a discourteous question lawrence decided 22
 this young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious; he had to find out
 the secretary did not tell him at what cost at what loneliness he learned these things
 he merely said any good decorator these days can make you a tasteful home
 the vice president said if you hear of any names that would fix me cheap in return for advertising they decorated the vice president's home let me know
 i can do business with that kind
 again lawrence thought a little sadly these were the fees of poverty and ambition
 boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously 10
 he had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years 10
 th ey had brandy in the library
 boxell looked at lawrence with a searching glance the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial
 what are your weaknesses? 21
  where will you break? 15
  how best to destroy your peace? 10
    the vice president said with a slight bluster there isn't anyone who loves the president more than i do
 old chris is my ideal
 at the same time you have to face facts and realize that a man who's been in the marine corps all his life doesn't understand much about politics
 what does a monk know about sex? 13
    lawrence listened with the practiced deceptive calm of the lawyer but his face was in the shadow
 so we have to protect the old man for his own good 7
 you see what i mean
 congress is full of politicians and if you want to get along with them you have to be politic
 this is why i say we just can't go ahead and disarm the germans and pull down our own defenses
 let me tell you what happened to me today 11
 a fellow came up to me a senator i don't have to tell you his name and he told me 'i love the president like a brother but god damn it he's crucifying me
 i've got a quarter of a million germans in my state and those krautheads tune in on father werther every night and if he tells them to go out and piss in the public square that's what they do 5
 he's telling them now to write letters to their congressmen opposing the disarmament of germany'
 and another one comes to me and he says 'look here there's a mill in my state employs five thousand people making uniforms for the navy
 the bishop looked at him coldly and said take it or leave i t! literally there was nothing else to do
 he was caught in a machine
 but sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly: let's go and see what it's like
 annisberg was about seventy-five miles west of birmingham near the georgia border and on the tallahoosa river a small and dirty stream 5
 the city was a center of manufacture especially in textiles and also because of the beauty of some of its surroundings a residence for many owners of the great industries in north alabama
 but it had as was usual in southern cities of this sort a black bottom a low region near the river where the negroes lived- servants and laborers huddl ed together in a region with no sewage save the river where streets and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime
 wilson came by train from birmingham and looked the city over; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief stores were
 beyond were industries and factories
 then they went down to black bottom
 in the midst of this crowded region was the allen african methodist episcopal church
 it was an old and dirty wooden structure sadly in need of repair
 but it was a landmark
 it had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town black and white knew of it
 it had just suffered a calamity the final crisis in a long series of calamities
 for the old preacher who had been there twenty-five years was dead and the city mourned him
 he was a loud-voiced man once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength and ability
 he was stern and overbearing with his flock but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites especially the rich who partly supported the church
 the deacon board headed by a black man named carlson had practically taken over as the pastor grew old and had its way with the support of the amen corner
 the characteristic thing about this church was its amen corner and the weekly religious orgy
 a knot of old worshippers chiefly women listened weekly to a sermon
 it began invariably in low tones almost conversational and then gradually worked up to high shrill appeals to god and man 8
 and then the amen corner took hold re-enacting a form of group participation in worship that stemmed from years before the greek chorus spreading down through the african forest overseas to the west indies and then here in alabama
 with shout and slow dance with tears and song with scream and contortion the corner group was beset by hysteria and shivering wailing shouting possession of something that seemed like an alien and outside force
 it spread to most of the audience and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief and afterward discussed negro religion
 it sometimes ended in death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and floor
 to most of those who composed the amen corner it was a magnificent and beautiful experience something for which they lived from week to week
 it was often re-enacted in less wild form at the wednesday night prayer meeting
 wilson on his first sunday witnessed this with something like disgust
 he had preached a short sermon trying to talk man- to-man to the audience to tell them who he was what he had done in macon and birmingham and what he proposed to do here
 he sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor 9
 but then at mention of that name the amen corner broke loose 9
 he had no chance to say another word
 at the very end when the audience was silent and breathless a collection was taken and then slowly everyone filed out 10
 the audience did not think much of the new pastor and what the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to say 9
 during the next weeks he looked over the situation 13
 first of all there was the parsonage an utterly impossible place for civilized people to live in originally poorly conceived apparently not repaired for years with no plumbing or sewage with rat-holes and rot
 it was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old members of the church a woman named catt who as wilson afterward found was briefly referred to as the cat because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative
 ann catt was a lonely devoted soul never married conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church but a perpetual dissenter and born critic
 she soared over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository
 then wilson looked over the church and studied its condition 7
 the salary of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in arrears
 wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2500 but when he mentioned this to the deacons they said nothing
 the church itself must be repaired
 it was dirty and neglected
 it really ought to be rebuilt and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks about this
 meanwhile the city itself should be talked to
 the streets in the colored section were dirty
 there was typhoid and malaria
 the children had nowhere to go and no place to play not even sidewalks
 the school was small dark and ill-equipped
 the teacher was a pliant fool
 there were two liquor saloons not very far from the church one white that is conducted for white people with a side entrance for negroes; the other exclusively negro
 undoubtedly there was a good deal of gambling in both 12
 on the other side of the church was a quiet well-kept house with shutters and recently painted
 it was called kent house
 the deacon of the church carlson was its janitor 8
 one of the leading members of the amen corner was cook; there were two or three colored maids employed there
 wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people which seemed to him rather queer
 why should a white hotel be set down in the center of black bottom? 12
  but nevertheless it looked respectable
 he was glad to have it there
 the rest of black bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect disrepair and careful upkeep
 dives carefully repaired huts and nicely painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl with little distinction 6
 the best could not escape from the worst and the worst nestled cosily beside the better
 the yards front and back were narrow; some were trash dumps some had flower gardens
 behind were privies for there was no sewage system 7
 after looking about a bit wilson discovered beyond black bottom across the river and far removed from the white city a considerable tract of land and it occurred to him that the church and the better negro homes might gradually be moved to this plot
 he talked about it to the presiding elder 14
 the presiding elder looked him over rather carefully 10
 he was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand 15
 but there was one thing that he had to stress and that was that the contribution to the general church expenses the dollar money had been seriously falling behind in this church and that must be looked after immediately
 in fact he intimated clearly that that was the reason that wilson had been sent here- to make a larger contribution of dollar money 6
 wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was they must have a better church a more business-like conduct of the church organization and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship into a modern church organization 7
 he emphasized to the presiding elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the river
 the presiding elder was sure that that would be impossible 10
 but he told wilson to go ahead and try
 it did seem impossible
 the bank which held the mortgage on the old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears and the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was being held for an eventual development for white working people who were coming in and that none would be sold to colored folk
 when it was proposed to rebuild the church wilson found that the terms for a new mortgage were very high
 he was sure that he could do better if he went to atlanta to get the deal financed
 but when this proposal was made to his deacon board he met unanimous opposition
 the church certainly would not be removed
 the very proposition was sacrilege
 it had been here fifty years
 it was going to stay forever
 it was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject 10
 as for rebuilding well that might be looked into but there was no hurry no hurry at all
 wilson again went downtown to a different banker an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic but he shook his head 5
 reverend he said i think you don't quite understand the situation here
 don't you see the amount of money that has been invested by whites around that church? 3
  tenements stores saloons some gambling i hope not too much 9
 the colored people are getting employment at kent house and other places and they are near their places of employment 5
 when a city has arranged things like this you cannot easily change them
 now if i were you i would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten years
 by that time perhaps something better can be done 12
 then wilson asked what about this kent house which you mention? 7
  i don't understand why a white hotel should be down here 6
 the young banker looked at him with a certain surprise and then he said flatly: i'm afraid i can't tell you anything in particular about kent house
 you'll have to find out about it on your own
 hope to see you again
 and he dismissed the colored pastor
 it was next day that sojourner came and sat beside him and took his hand
 she said my dear do you know what kent house is? 12
    no said wilson i don't
 i was just asking about it
 what is it? 22
    it's a house of prostitution for white men with white girls as inmates
 they hire a good deal of local labor including two members of our trustee board
 they buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized by some of the best white gentlemen in town
 my dear you must be mistaken
 talk to mrs catt she said
 and after wilson had talked to mrs catt and to others he was absolutely amazed
 this of course was the sort of thing that used to take place in southern cities- putting white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods and carrying them on openly 8
 but it had largely disappeared on account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the part of the negroes as they became more educated and got better wages
 but this situation of kent house was more subtle
 the wages involved were larger and more regular 10
 the inmates were white and from out of town avoiding local friction
 the backing from the white town was greater and there was little publicity
 good wages patronage and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from negroes
 and yet wilson knew that this place must go or he must go 7
 and for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end of his career in the methodist church if not in all churches
 payne dismounted in madison place and handed the reins to herold 6
 there was a fog which increased the darkness of the night 15
 two gas lamps were no more than a misleading glow 10
 he might have been anywhere or nowhere
 the pretence was that he was delivering a prescription from dr verdi
 secretary of state seward was a sick man
 the idea had come from herold who had once been a chemist's clerk 10
 the sick were always receiving medicines
 no one would question such an errand
 the bottle was filled up with flour
 before payne loomed the old clubhouse seward's home where key had once been killed
 now it would have another death
 from the outside it was an ordinary enough house of the gentry 9
 he clomped heavily up the stoop and rang the bell 10
 like the bell at mass the doorbell was pitched too high 8
 it was still good friday after all
 a nigger boy opened the door
 payne did not notice him
 he was thinking chiefly of cap
 if their schedules were to synchronize there was no point in wasting time
 he pushed his way inside
 for a moment the hall confused him
 this was the largest house he had ever been in almost the largest building except for a hotel
 he had no idea where seward's room would be 15
 in the half darkness the banisters gleamed and the hall seemed enormous
 above him somewhere were the bedrooms
 seward would be up there
 he explained his errand but without bothering much to make it plausible for he felt something well up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army
 he did not really want to kill but as in the sexual act there was a moment when the impulse took over and could not be downed even while you watched yourself giving way to it
 he was no longer worried
 everything would be all right
 he knew that in this mood he could not be stopped
 still the sensation always surprised him
 it was a thrill he felt no part in
 he could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while his body did these quick appalling and efficient things
 he brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs 7
 they were carpeted but made for pumps and congress gaiters not the great clodhoppers he wore
 the sound of his footsteps was like a muffled drum 13
 at the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown
 he stopped and whispered his errand
 young frederick seward held out his hand
 panting a little payne shook his head
 dr verdi had told him to deliver his package in person 7
 frederick seward said his father was sleeping and then went through a pantomime at his father's door to prove the statement 6
 i will go
 he smiled but now that he knew where the elder seward was he did not intend to go
 he pulled out his pistol and fired it
 it had misfired
 reversing it he smashed the butt down on frederick seward's head over and over again
 it was the first blow that was always difficult 23
 after that violence was exultantly easy
 he got caught up into it and became a different person 12
 only afterwards did an act like that become meaningless so that he would puzzle over it for days whereas at the time it had seemed quite real
 the nigger boy fled down the stairs screaming murder 9
 it was not murder at all
 payne was more methodical than that
 he was merely clearing a way to what he had to do 8
 he ran for the sick room found his pistol was broken and threw it away
 from childhood he had known all about knives
 someone blocked the door from inside
 he smashed it in and tumbled into darkness
 he saw only dimly moving figures but when he slashed them they yelled and fled
 he went for the bed jumped on it and struck where he could repeatedly
 it was like finally getting into one's own nightmares to punish one's dreams
 two men pulled him off
 payne hacked at their arms
 there was a lady there in a nightdress
 he would not have wanted to hurt a lady
 another man approached this one fully dressed 8
 when the knife went into his chest he went down at once 10
 i'm mad shouted payne as he ran out into the hall 4
 i'm mad and only wished he had been
 that would have made things so much easier
 but he was not mad
 he clattered down the stairs and out of the door 8
 somewhere in the fog the nigger boy was still yelling murder 11
 one always wakes up even from one's own dreams
 the clammy air revived him
 herold he saw had fled
 well one did not expect much of people like herold 9
 he unhitched his horse walked it away mounted and spurred it on
 the nigger boy was close behind him
 then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone 10
 he rode on and on
 he had no idea where he was
 after some time he came to an open field
 an open field was better than a building that was for sure so he dismounted turned off the horse and plunged through the grass 5
 he felt curiously sleepy the world seemed far away; he knew he should get to cap but he didn't know how
 he was sure for he had done as he was told hadn't he? 9
  cap would find him and take care of him
 so choosing a good tree he clambered up into it found a comfortable notch and curled up in it to sleep like the tousled bear he was with his hands across his chest as though surfeited with honey 4
 violence always made him tired but he was not frightened 9
 in boston edwin booth was winding up a performance of a new way to pay old debts
 it was a part so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more
 on a stage he always knew what to do and tonight to judge by the applause he must be doing it better than usual
 as sir giles overreach he raised his arm and declaimed: where is my honour now? 7
    that was one of the high spots of the play 17
 the audience as usual loved it
 he was delighted to see them so happy
 if he had any worries it was only the small ones about mother in new york and his daughter edwina and what she might be doing at this hour with her aunt asia in philadelphia
 everyone is ambivalent about his profession if he has practised it long enough but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all those unseen people out there who might cheer you or boo you but that was largely though not entirely up to you
 they made the world seem friendly somehow though he knew it was not
 wilkes was quite right about one thing
 laura keene had been in the green room
 the commotion had brought her into the wings
 since she could not act one part suited her as well as any other and so she was the first person to offer mr lincoln a glass of water holding it up to the box high above her head to miss harris who had asked for it
 she had been one of the first to collect her wits 14
 it was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience as that they had been stunned already
 most of them had seen our american cousin before and unless miss keene was on stage there was not much to it
 the theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom 10
 the stage had been empty except for harry hawk doing his star monologue
 the audience was fond of harry hawk he was a dear in or out of character but he was not particularly funny
 at the end of the monologue the audience would applaud 10
 meanwhile it looked at the scenery
 well i guess i know enough to turn you inside out you sockdologizing old mantrap! said trenchard otherwise hawk 5
 there was always a pause here before the next line 14
 that was when the gun went off
 yet even that explosion did not mean much
 guns were going off all over washington city these days because of the celebrations and the theatre was not soundproof 5
 then the audience saw a small dim figure appear at the edge of the presidential box
 sic semper tyrannis it said mildly
 booth had delivered his line
 behind him billowed a small pungent cloud of smoke 8
 they had not heard what had been said
 they had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily 12
 the figure leapt from the box almost lost its balance the flag draped there tore in the air the figure landed on its left leg fell on its hands and pressed itself up
 harry hawk still had his arm raised towards the wings 6
 he did not lower his arm
 the figure was so theatrically dressed that it was as though a character from some other play had blundered into this one 5
 the play for saturday night was to be a benefit performance of the octoroon
 this figure looked like the slave dealer from that 8
 but it also looked like a toad hopping away from the light 12
 there was something maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them
 then it disappeared into the wings
 harry hawk had not shifted position but he at last lowered his arm
 there was no mistaking that scream
 it was what anyone who had ever seen her had always expected her to do
 yet this scream had a different note in it
 that absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them awake like a pail of water
 clara harris one of the guests in the box stood up and demanded water
 when something unexpected happened one always asked for water if one were a woman brandy if one were a man
 in the presidential box someone leaned over the balustrade and yelled: he has shot the president!   that got everybody up 8
 on the stage harry hawk began to weep
 laura keene brushed by him with the glass of water 10
 the crowd began to move
 in washington city everyone lived in a bubble of plots and one death might attract another
 it was not exactly panic they gave way to but they could not just sit there
 the beehive voices for no one could bear silence drowned out the sound of mrs lincoln's weeping
 at the rear of the auditorium upstairs some men tried to push open the door to the box corridor
 a dr charles taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to hoist him up to the box
 in the audience a man named ferguson lost his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob on the same principle which had led miss harris to demand water
 someone opened the corridor door from the inside and called for a doctor
 somehow dr charles leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out into the dingy corridor
 he went straight to the presidential box
 as usual mrs lincoln had lost her head but nobody blamed her for doing so now
 there was a little blood on the hem of her dress for the assassin had slashed miss harris's companion maj or rathbone with a knife 9
 rathbone said he was bleeding to death
 by the look of him he wasn't that far gone
 with a sneer the man spread his legs and a third time confronted them
 once more katie reared and whinnied in fear
 for a moment boy and mount hung in midair 10
 stevie twisted and frantically commanded the mare to leap straight ahead
 but the stranger was nimbler still
 with a bold arm he dared once more to obstruct them 10
 katie reared a third time then trembling descended 7
 seizing the bridle he tugged with all his might and forced katie to her knees
 stevie could feel himself toppling
 he saw the ground coming up- and the stranger's head 12
 with incredible ferocity he brought his fists together and struck 6
 the blow encountered silky hair and hard bone 11
 the man uttered a weird cry spun about and collapsed in the sand 8
 katie scrambled to her feet stevie agilely retaining his seat 8
 again katie reared and now wickedly he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again upon the sprawled figure of the stranger 5
 he could feel his own feet iron-shod striking repeatedly until the body was limp
 he gloated and his lips slavered
 they rode around and around to trample the figure into the sand 9
 only the top of the head with a spot bare and white as a clamshell remained visible
 a train hooted
 they were pursuing him
 he was frightened; his fists clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt
 then katie stumbled and again he was falling falling!   stevie! stevie! his mother was nudging him but he was still falling 6
 his head hung over the boards of katie's stall; before it was sprawled the mangled corpse of the bearded stranger
 stevie wake up now! we're nearly there
 he was safe in his mama's arms
 houses winked as the cars rolled beside a little depot 6
 po' chavis! the trainman called
 he came by and repeated po' chavis! 6 bong! bong! startled him awake
 the room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it 10
 bong! a dull boom and a throbbing echo
 the walls bulged the floor trembled the windowpanes rattled 9
 he stared at the far morning expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon
 bong! he raced to the window and yanked at the sash 7
 bong! the wood was old the paint alligatored
 bong! a fresh breeze saluted him
 six o'clock!   he put his his head out
 there was the slate roof of the church; ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green-scaled monster
 the clock which had struck presented an innocent face 8
 in the kitchen mama was wiping the cupboards
 there's a tower and a steeple on the church a million feet high 3
 and the loudest clock in the whole world! i know stephen she smiled
 they say that our steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high
 the clock you heard strike- it's really the town clock- was installed last april by mrs shorter on her birthday
 he dressed and sped outdoors
 he crossed broome street to orange square
 the steeple leaned backward while the church advanced like a headless creature in a long shapeless coat
 the spire seemed to hold up the sky
 port jervis basking in the foothills was the city of god 7
 the dutch reformed church with two steeples and its own school was on main street; the episcopal church was one block down sussex street; the catholic saint mary's church with an even taller steeple and a cross on top stood on ball street
 the catholics had the largest cemetery near the neversink river where main street ran south; stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds
 god was everywhere in the belfry in the steeple in the clouds in the trees and in the mountains hulking on the horizon
 somewhere beyond where shadows lurked must be the yawning pit of which papa preached and the dreadful lake of fire
 so walking in awe he became familiar with god who resided chiefly in drew centennial church with its high steeple and clock 7
 there was no church like drew church no preacher like papa who was intimate with him and could consign sinners to hellfire 7
 to know god he must follow in papa's footsteps
 he was fortunate and proud
 the veterans idling on their benches in the square beneath the soldiers' monument got to their feet when papa approached: morning reverend! his being and his will- stevie could not divide god from his papa- illumined every parish face turned the choir into a band of angels and the pulpit into the tollgate to heaven
 we have nine hundred and eleven members in our charge mama announced and three hundred and eighty sunday-school scholars 6
 when papa went out to do god's work stevie often accompanied him in the buggy which was drawn by violet the new black mare 8
 although they journeyed westerly as far as germantown beyond the erie roundhouse and the machine shop and along the delaware and hudson canal and northward to brooklyn below point peter he could see the church spire wherever he looked back
 sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse- afternoon reverend!- and crossed the suspension bridge to matamoras; that was pennsylvania
 in the delaware river three long islands were overgrown with greening trees and underbrush
 south of laurel grove cemetery and below the junction of the neversink and the delaware was the tri-state rock from which stevie could spy new jersey and pennsylvania as well as new york simply by spinning around on his heel
 on these excursions papa instructed him on man's chief end which was his duty to god and his own salvation
 however a boy's lively eyes might rove
 where cuddleback brook purled into the neversink was a magnificent swimming hole
 papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing youth: idle recreation! stevie saw no idols; it troubled him that he couldn't always see what papa saw
 he was torn between the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging northward on the monticello branch 6
 where you been today? 17
  ludie inquired every evening pretending that he did not care 7
 he'll make a preacher out of you!   no he won't! stevie flared 5
 not me!   somebody's got to be a preacher in the family 8
 he made a will and last testament before we left paterson 13
 i heard them! uncle and aunt howe were the witnesses 8
 will he die? 18
    everybody does
 to speak of papa dying was a sin
 it could never happen as long as god was alert and the drew steeple stood guard with its peaked lance
 stevie was constantly slipping into the church
 he pulled with all his strength at the heavy brass-bound door and shuffled along the wainscoted wall
 the cold mysterious presence of god was all around him 8
 at the end of a shaft of light the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon
 far away standing before a curtained window in the study room was his father hands tucked under his coattails and staring into the dark church
 the figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence 8
 the boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles and gray hair
 would papa really die? 12
  the mouth was thin-lipped and wide the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide
 when papa's slender fingers removed the spectacles there were red indentations on the bridge of the strong nose
 it's time you began to think on god stephen
 perhaps one day he will choose you as he chose me long ago 6
 therefore give him your affection and store up his love for you 8
 open your heart to him and pray stephen pray! for his mercy and his guidance to spare you from evil and eternal punishment in the lake of fire
 stevie had heard these words many times yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble
 for he feared the lake of fire
 he strove to think of god and his eternal wrath; he must pray to be spared
 papa was disappointed that none of the brothers had heard the call 6
 not george townley or ted certainly not ludie 11
 burt was at hackettstown and will at albany law school where they surely could not hear it
 someday god would choose him
 he would hear the call and would run to tell papa 9
 the stern face would relax the black-clad arms would embrace him my son! yet how might he know the call when it came? 6
  probably as in scriptures a still small voice would whisper 7
 it would summon him once; if he missed it never again 13
 what if it came when he was playing or was asleep and dreaming? 6
  he must not fail to hear it
 he was papa's chosen; therefore nothing but good could happen to him even in god's wrathful storms
 when the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley he was unafraid
 aggie might fly into a closet shut the door and bury her head in the clothes; he dared to wait for the lightning
 lightning could strike you blind if you were a sinner! but he was good
 he clenched his fists and faced the terror
 thunder crashed; barrels tumbled down the mountainsides and bounced and bounced till their own fury split them open
 lightning might strike the steeples of the other churches; not of drew church
 a flash illumined the trees as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions
 violet whinnied from the stable
 he ran out into the downpour sped across the yard and into the buggy room
 don't be afraid violet! he shouted and was aghast at the echoes 3
 don't you be afraid! he would save her
 if there was a fire or a flood he would save mama first and violet next
 drenched and shaking he stood near the sweet-smelling stall and dared to pat her muzzle
 don't you be afraid violet!   after the storm the sky cleared blue and cool and fragrant air swept the hills
 when the sun came out stevie strode proudly into orange square smiling like a landlord on industrious tenants
 the fountain had brimmed over the cannon were wet the soldiers' monument glistened
 even before the benches had dried the civil war veterans were straggling back to their places
 the great spire shone as if the lightning had polished it 8
 the pointed shadow had nearly touched him
 he trailed ludie to the baseball game in the lot on kingston street near the dutch reformed
 go on home! ludie screeched at him
 someone'll tell papa!   no one told on ludie not even when he slipped live grasshoppers into the mite-box
 ludie did as he pleased
 ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot at crows
 ludie had a cigar box full of marbles and shooters and a roman candle from last fourth of july
 ludie hopped rides on freight cars and was chased by mr yankton the railroad guard
 he came home overheated ran straight to the ice-chest and gulped shivery cold water
 that ludie! he too cocked his cap at a jaunty angle jingled marbles in his pocket and swaggered down main street
 on the christophers' lawn little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at a tea party
 a newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his size 7
 stevie yearned for a dog
 he wondered whether god had a dog in the sky
 he meandered down pike street past the first national bank with its green window shades
 he crossed the tracks to delaware house where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah
 a tall lady with a ruffled collar very low on her bosom turned insolent green eyes upon him
 she was taller than aggie
 she was so beautiful with her rosy mouth and haughty air that she had to be wicked
 fiddles screeched; a piano tinkled
 p j- as ludie called the town- was crowded with summer people who came to the mountains to escape the heat in the big cities 7
 they stayed at hotels and boardinghouses or at private homes 8
 rich people went to delaware house opera house american house or fowler house
 if the crummy bastard could write! that's how it should be 8
 it's those two fucken niggers! krist i wish they could write! nigger pussy
 he thought of sweet wet nigger pussy
 oh sweet land of heaven haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy! he thought of her the first one
 he had caught her coming out of the shack 10
 she was a juicy one
 oh how they bounced! fresh warm sweet and juicy sweet lovin sixteen she was
 man how i love nigger pussy! the snow came a little faster now he noted
 he thought of joe harris the nigger who had gone after his sister 7
 he chuckled the memory vivid
 jee- sus we fixed him! yooee we fixed him! the snow again 6
 if only the fucken weather wasn't so lousy! goddamn niggers lord 13
 what i have to put up with! sonuvabitch i can't figure out what in hell for they went and put niggers in my squad for
 only one worth a shit and that's brandon
 he ain't so bad h   his thoughts turned to other things h the big shock everybody had when they found ol slater and those others done for 5
 he had been pretty scared himself wondering what the hell was coming off
 but he soon saw which way the ball was bouncing 12
 soon came back to his senses
 i soon came back to my senses he said aloud to the young blizzard proudly drawing himself up as if making a report to some important superior h i was the first to get my squad on the ball and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb
 that goddamn redheader was the worst
 he kept sayin not me not me i don't wanta wind up like em 7
 but i told him goddammit
 i told him he said aloud h they'll get the guys that done it 8
 that'll put the place back to normal
 maybe it's a good thing it happened
 maybe they'll stop it now once for al l
 they're doin it now
 i hear the whole bunch is croakin out in the snow 10
 they'll get the guys that done it h there was something troubling him though: as yet they hadn't h five days h keerist h prickly twinges of annoyance ran through him
 his eyes blinked hard snapping on and squashing some bad things that were trying to push their way into him
 a tune began to whirl inside his head
 one of his favorites: guitar boogie
 it always came on faithfully just like a radio or juke box whenever he started to worry too much about something when the bad things tried to push their way into him
 the music drove them off or away and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments humming and jiving within beating the rhythm within
 he glowed with anticipation about what would happen to the culprits when they caught them h turn the bastards over to me- to me and my boys- no nigger ever got what would be comin to them- reactionary bastards h
 he had never heard the word reactionary before his life as a pow began
 it was a word he was proud of a word that meant much to him and he used it with great pleasure almost as if it were an exclusive possession and more: he sensed himself to be very highly educated four cuts above any of the folks back home h four cuts at least he chuckled to himself and i owe it all to them
 the word also made him feel hate sincere hate for those so labeled
 he used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball
 it came up again and again in the discussion sessions h lousy reactionary bastards been tryin to fuck up the program for months 8
 hired hard lackeys of the warmongering capitalists 7
 to fuck up the program
 remember that h he heard himself haranguing them 8
 he saw himself before them delivering the speech 13
 he laughed suddenly feeling a surge of power telling him of his hold over them seeing himself before them receiving utmost respect and attention
 one day ching had told him as they walked to the weekly conference of squad leaders keep it up your squad is good one of the best keep it up keep up the good work
 he would! that was really something coming from ching h really something he said aloud h dirty reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and bumpin off ol slater and those other poor bastards 5
 they'll get them by god and let them bring them down here to me just let them god i'll slice their balls right off h his arm moved swiftly violently once twice
 he was tingling within
 before him mutilated bleeding to death they lay
 it was as if it had been done
 bastards he said aloud spitting on them
 he halted and looked around
 rivers of cold sweat were suddenly unleashed within him 8
 the thought came back the one nagging at him these past four days 6
 he tried to stifle it
 but the words were forming
 he braced himself h somebody'll hafta start thinkin h he fought it seeking to kill the last few words but on they came h bout takin- his h he was trembling a strange feeling upon him fully expecting some catastrophe to strike him dead on the spot
 and he took heart; the final word came forth h place h now he heard it fully: h bout takin his place h he listened waited nothing happened
 his old self
 the music arrived taking him h its rhythm stroked him snaked all through him the lyrics lifted him took him from one magic isle to another stopping briefly at each h brandon
 but a nigger
 jesus the guy says he is trying
 but he isn't with it not at all with it
 when i talked to ching about it he said everyone can learn if he is not a reactionary or lazy
 that's what he said
 it is plain as hell johnson is no reactionary 13
 so you're not tryin johnson you bastard you h he looked over at him lying there asleep and he felt a wave of revulsion
 sleepy-eyed soft-spoken johnson h biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad h he was the guy what always goofed at question time h why couldn't they have dumped him off on someone else? 4
  why me? 23
  why didn't the damn reactionaries bump him off? 8
  why slate r? 23
  h like a particle drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind
 the music surged up but it failed to check it 10
 who is the man to take his place? 7
  the guy with most on the ball
 thoroughly wised up
 knows the score h with a supreme effort he broke it off 7
 he turned to the window again
 a gnawing and gnashing within him
 the snow was tumbling down furiously now
 huge glob-flakes hitting the ground piling higher and higher 8
 he stared at it amazed alarmed h the whole fucken sky's cavin in! keeeerist! lookit it! cover the whole building bury us all by nightfall
 jesus! h somebody got to be somebody h if i don't put my two cents in soon somebody else will h i know they're waitin only for one thing: for the bastards what done it to be nailed
 maybe they already got them
 he was again tingling with pleasure seeing himself clearly in slater's shoes
 top dog sleeping and eating right there with the staff 6
 ching tien all of them h top dog h poor ol slater h jesus imagine the crummy bastards they'll get em they'll get what's comin to em h he whirled about suddenly
 it was nothing though his heart was thumping wildly 14
 that was all
 boy you're stirrin early a sleepy voice said
 yehhh said coughlin testily eyeing him up and down 8
 lookit that come down willya said the man scratching himself yawning
 yehhh said coughlin practically spitting on him
 that's the way
 keep the chatter to a minimum short answers one word if possible 10
 less bull the more you can do with um
 all he does is to bullshit with his squad and they are the stupidest bastards around
 just about to get their asses kicked into hut seven 9
 plenty of room there now
 all those dumb 8-balls croaked
 you can do anything with these dumb fucks if you know how 14
 they'd cut their mothers' belly open
 see he's already snapping it up the dumb jerk h coughlin grinned feeling supremely on top of things h he watched the snow once again
 it made no sense to him h he whirled around suddenly hot all over finding the man who had been standing before him a few moments back nailing him to the spot on which he now stood open-mouthed-   you- listen!- name william foster's four internal contradictions in capitalism
 quick- quick- now!   the man shrank before the hot fury searching frantically for the answer h   finnegan woke up
 there was a hell of a noise this time of morning 12
 he stared out the window
 for christ's sake! the whole fucken sky's caved in! he looked for the source of the noise that had awakened him h it was that prick coughlin
 what the hell was he up to now? 12
  why didn't he drop dead? 10
  how did they miss him when they got slater? 12
  how? 15
  h then he was asking himself the usual early morning questions: what the hell am i doin here? 7
  is this a nut-house? 10
  am i nuts? 13
  is this for real? 16
  am i dreamin? 13
  h   from somewhere in the hut came coughlin's voice 8
 how long did you study? 14
  how long buddy? 15
    for christ's sake! a voice pleaded
 don't christsake me buddy! just answer
 c'mon- c'mon! h i'm no hero
 did i start the damn war? 9
  h automatically finnegan started going over today's lesson h capitalism rots from the core
 did i start the damn war? 9
  who did? 23
  that's a good one
 why don't uncle sam mind his own fucken business? 10
  i'll bet both together did
 goddammit
 just let me go home to jersey back to the shore oh jesus the shore
 the waves breakin in on you and your girl at night there on the warm beach in the moonlight even jesus sweet mary
 if i hafta do this to stay alive by god i'll do it 9
 i hated the goddamn army from the first day i got in anyhow 10
 all pricks like coughlin run it anyway one way or another 8
 fuck them h he rolled over and tried to shut out the noise now much louder
 he snuggled into the blanket h brandon dreamed 10
 he was sitting on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water
 a river wide as the missouri where it ran by his place 7
 but he was not
 so what? 18
  why should i be spinning just because the goddamn log is spinning? 10
  
 over on the bank the west bank a man stood calling to him 8
 he couldn't make out what he was saying
 no doubt it had to do with the log
 why should he be concerned? 12
  rousseau is so persuasive that voltaire is almost convinced that he should burn his books too
 but while the two men are riding into the country where they are going to dinner they are attacked in the dark of the forest by a band of thieves who strip them of everything including most of their clothes 5
 you must be a very learned man says voltaire to one of the bandits
 a learned man? 17
  the bandit laughs in his face
 he goes to the chief himself
 at what university did you study? 17
  he asks
 he refuses to believe that the bandit chief never attended a higher institution
 to have become so corrupt he says surely you must have studied many arts and sciences
 the chief annoyed by these questions knocks voltaire down and shouts at him that he not only never went to any school but never even learned how to read
 when finally the two bedraggled men reach their friend's home voltaire's fears are once again aroused
 for it is such a distinguished place with such fine works of art and such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the owner has become depraved by all this culture
 to voltaire's surprise however their host gives them fresh clothes to put on opens his purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner
 immediately after dinner however rousseau asks for still another favor
 could he have pen and paper please? 8
  he is in a hurry to write another essay against culture 16
 such was the impromptu that voltaire gave to howls of laughter at sans souci and that was soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of europe to be printed sometime later but with the name of timon of athens the famous misanthrope substituted for that of rousseau
 how cruel!   but at the same time how understandable 18
 how could the rich for whom life was made so simple ever understand the subterfuges the lies the frauds the errors sins and even crimes to which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages the rich had in the race of life? 5
    how for example could a voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a rousseau would find himself when soon after the furor of his first discourse he acquired still another title to fame? 7
    this time as a musician
 ever since he had first begun to study music and to teach it rousseau had dreamed of piercing through to fame as the result of a successful opera
 but his facility in this genre was not great 10
 and his efforts to get a performance for his gallant muses invariably failed
 his operatic music had little merit
 but then one day while on a week's visit to the country home of a retired swiss jeweler rousseau amused the company with a few little melodies he had written to which he attached no great importance 7
 he was really amazed to discover the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs
 put a few such songs together they urged him 11
 string them onto some sort of little plot and you'll have a delightful operetta
 nonsense he said
 this is the sort of stuff i write and then throw away!   heaven forbid! cried the ladies enchanted by his music
 you must make an opera out of this materia l 10
 and they wouldn't leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised
 oh the irony and the bitterness of it! that after all his years of effort to become a composer he should now now when he was still stoutly replying to the critics of his discourse on the arts and sciences be so close to a success in music and have to reject it 6
 or at least appear to reject it!   but what else could he do? 7
  you couldn't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time practice them could you? 10
  well yes perhaps in literature since you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against literature and so were involved in spite of yourself
 but now music too? 28
  no
 that would be too much!   and the fault of course was rameau's 11
 the fault was rameau's and that of the whole culture of this parisian age
 for it was rameau's type of music that he had been trying to write and that he couldn't write
 these little songs however were sweet nothings from the heart tender memories of his childhood little melodies that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep
 he couldn't appear as a composer now
 that glory craved for so long was now forbidden to him 7
 still just for the ladies and just for this once for this one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of his melodies
 the ladies were delighted and jean jacques was applauded 7
 and everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote 8
 but then after the little operetta had been given its feeble amateur rendering everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited
 rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance
 the ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him 8
 a contradiction? 21
  bah what was a contradiction in one's life? 7
  every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes and saying yes when she meant no
 rousseau had to admit that though he couldn't agree to a public performance he would indeed just for his own private satisfaction dearly love to know how his work would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices
 i'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people seem to think he said
 duclos the historian pointed out to jean jacques that this was impossible
 the musicians of the royal opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound
 merely to satisfy the author's curiosity
 but he recalled that rameau had once had a private performance of his opera armide behind closed doors just for himself alone 8
 duclos understood what was bothering rousseau: that the writer of the prosopopoeia of fabricius should now become known as the writer of an amusing little operetta
 that would certainly be paradoxical
 but duclos thought he saw a way out
 let me do the submitting to the royal academy he suggested 10
 your name will never appea r
 no one will even suspect that it is your work
 to that rousseau could agree
 but now what crazy twists and turns of his emotions!   afraid at one and the same time that his work might be turned down- which would be a blow to his pride even though no one knew he was the author- and that the work would be accepted and then that his violent feelings in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself
 and how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause! and thus torn between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity rousseau suffered through several painful weeks 5
 all these emotions were screwed up to new heights when after acceptance and the first rehearsals there ensued such a buzz of excitement among parisian music lovers that duclos had to come running to rousseau to inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the king's amusements and that he was now demanding that the work be offered first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau 6
 imagine the honor of it!   what was your answer? 8
  jean jacques asked striving to appear unimpressed 12
 what else could i do? 11
  monsieur de cury was incensed of course
 but i said i would first have to get the author's permission 13
 and i was certain he would refuse
 how infuriating all this was! why had not this success come to him before he had plunged into his discourse and before he had committed himself to a life of austerity and denial? 4
  now when everything was opening up to him- even the court of louis 15!- he had to play a role of self-effacement
 back and forth duclos had to go between m de cury and jean jacques and between the duke d'aumont and jean jacques again as his little operetta the village soothsayer though still unperformed took on ever more importance
 and of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends
 but they naturally kept his secret well and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical and court circles 7
 how titillating it was to go among people who did not know him as the composer but who talked in the most glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first rehearsals
 the furor was such that people who could not possibly have squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational 8
 and listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of chocolate in a cafe rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration trembling lest his authorship become known and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer
 he felt himself now as he himself says in his confessions at a crucial point of his life
 and that was why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal stables called to take him to the palace he did not bother to shave
 on the contrary he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of several days
 seeing him in that condition and about to enter the hall where the king the queen the whole royal family and all the members of the highest aristocracy would be present grimm and the abbe raynal and others tried to stop him
 you can't go in that way! they cried
 why not? 23
  jean jacques asked
 who is going to stop me? 20
    you haven't dressed for the occasion! they pointed out to him 10
 i'm dressed as i always am rousseau said
 at home yes they argued
 but here you are in the palace
 and madame de pompadour
 if they are here then surely i have the right to be here rousseau said
 since i am the composer! but in such a slovenly condition 8
 what is slovenly about me? 11
  rousseau asked
 is it because of my slovenliness that hair grows on my face? 11
  surely it would grow there whether i washed myself or not 6
 a hundred years ago i would have worn a beard with pride 12
 and those without beards would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion
 now times have changed and i must pretend that hair doesn't grow on my face
 and fashion is the real king here
 not louis 15 since even he obeys
 now if you don't mind i should like to hear my own piece performed 5
 but of course behind his boldness he didn't feel bold at all 9
 he trembled lest his piece should fail
 and this in addition to his usual fear of being among people of high society
 his fear of making some inane or inappropriate remark 7
 and even deeper than that: his fear lest in this closed hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself
 could he walk out in the midst of his piece? 10
  here before the court? 13
  before the king? 19
  it was the first time any of us had laughed since the morning began
 the rider from concord was as good as his word
 he came spurring and whooping down the road his horse kicking up clouds of dust shouting:   they're a-coming! by god they're a-coming they are!   we heard him before he ever showed and we heard him yelling after he was out of sight
 solomon chandler hadn't misjudged the strength of his lungs not at all
 i think you could have heard him a mile away and he was bursting at every seam with importance
 i have observed that being up on a horse changes the whole character of a man and when a very small man is up on a saddle he'd like as not prefer to eat his meals there
 that's understandable and i appreciate the sentiment 5
 as for this rider i never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes i can't say; but i do know that he gave the day tone and distinction 5
 the last thing in the world that resembled a war was our line of farmers and storekeepers and mechanics perched on top of a stone wall and this dashing rider made us feel a good deal sharper and more alert to the situation
 we came down off the wall as if he had toppled all of us and we crouched behind it
 i have heard people talk with contempt about the british regulars but that only proves that a lot of people talk about things of which they are deplorably ignorant
 whatever we felt about the redcoats we respected them in terms of their trade which was killing; and i know that i myself was nauseated with apprehension and fear and that my hands were soaking wet where they held my gun
 i wanted to wipe my flint but i didn't dare to the state my hands were in just as i didn't dare to do anything about the priming 9
 the gun would fire or not just as chance willed 7
 i put a lot more trust in my two legs than in the gun because the most important thing i had learned about war was that you could run away and survive to talk about it
 the gunfire which was so near that it seemed just a piece up the road now stopped for long enough to count to twenty; and in that brief interval a redcoat officer came tearing down the road whipping his horse fit to kill
 i don't know whether he was after our rider who had gone by a minute before or whether he was simply scouting conditions; but when he passed us by a musket roared and he reared his horse swung it around and began to whip it back in the direction from which he had come 5
 he was a fine and showy rider but his skill was wasted on us 8
 from above me and somewhere behind me a rifle cracked 10
 the redcoat officer collapsed like a punctured bolster and the horse reared and threw him from the saddle except that one booted foot caught in the stirrup
 half crazed by the weight dragging the dust and the heat the horse leaped our wall dashing out the rider's brains against it and leaving him lying there among us- while the horse crashed away through the brush
 it was my initiation to war and the insane symphony war plays; for what had happened on the common was only terror and flight; but this grinning broken head not ten feet away from me was the sharp definition of what my reality had become
 and now the redcoats were coming and the gunfire was a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of us
 i must state that the faster things happened the slower they happened; the passage and rhythm of time changed and when i remember back to what happened then each event is a separate and frozen incident 5
 in my recollection there was a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreating redcoats and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seems to hover indefinitely
 yet it could not have been more than a matter of seconds and then the front of the british army came into view
 it was only hours since i had last seen them but they ha d changed and i had changed
 in the very front rank two men were wounded and staggered along trailing blood behind them
 no drummers here no pipers and the red coats were covered with a fine film of dust
 they marched with bayonets fixed and as fixed on their faces was anger fear and torment
 rank after rank of them came down the road and the faces were all the same and they walked in a sea of dust
 committeemen hold your fire! hold your fire! a voice called and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat ranks never paused for an instant only some of them glancing toward the stone wall from behind which the voice came
 the front of their column had already passed us when another officer came riding down the side of the road not five paces from where we were
 my cousin simmons carried a musket but he had loaded it with bird shot and as the officer came opposite him he rose up behind the wall and fired
 one moment there was a man in the saddle; the next a headless horror on a horse that bolted through the redcoat ranks and during the next second or two we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column of soldiers
 one moment the road was filled with disciplined troops marching four by four with a purpose as implacable as death; the next a cloud of gun smoke covered a screaming fury of sound out of which the redcoat soldiers emerged with their bayonets and their cursing fury 5
 in the course of this they had fired on us; but i have no memory of that
 i had squeezed the trigger of my own gun and to my amazement it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder with the force of an angry mule; and then i was adding my own voice to the crescendo of sound hurling more vile language than i ever thought i knew sobbing and shouting and aware that if i had passed water before it was not enough for my pants were soaking wet
 i would have stood there and died there if left to myself but cousin simmons grabbed my arm in his viselike grip and fairly plucked me out of there; and then i came to some sanity and plunged away with such extraordinary speed that i outdistanced cousin simmons by far 6
 later we realized that the redcoats had stopped their charge at the wall
 their only hope of survival was to hold to the road and keep marching
 we tumbled to a stop in deacon gordon's cow hole a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in its middle
 a dozen cows mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane as perhaps we were at that moment with the crazy excitement of our first encounter the yelling and shooting still continuing up at the road and the thirst of some of the men which was so great that they waded into the muddy water and scooped up handfuls of it
 isaac pitt one of the men from lincoln had taken a musket ball in his belly; and though he had found the strength to run with us now he collapsed and lay on the ground dying the reverend holding his head and wiping his hot brow
 it may appear that we were cruel and callous but no one had time to spend sympathizing with poor isaac- except the reverend 8
 i know that i myself felt that it was a mortal shame for a man to be torn open by a british musket ball as isaac had been yet i also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself 6
 i was drunk with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that came floating down from the road and the fact that i was not afraid now but only waiting to know what to do next
 meanwhile i reloaded my gun as the other men were doing 6
 we were less than a quarter of a mile from the road and we could trace its shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hung over it
 wherever you looked you saw committeemen running across the meadows some away from the road some toward it some parallel to it; and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty militia were making their way in our direction
 cousin joshua and some others felt that we should march toward lexington and take up new positions ahead of the slow-moving british column but another group maintained that we should stick to this spot and this section of road
 i didn't offer any advice but i certainly did not want to go back to where the officer lay with his brains dashed out
 someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it the british would be gone; but cousin simmons said he had watched them marching west early in the morning and moving at a much brisker pace it had still taken half an hour for their column to pass what with the narrowness of the road and their baggage and ammunition carts
 while this was being discussed we saw the militia to the west of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters of two and three men as they approached the road
 it was the opinion of some of us that these must be part of the committeemen who had been in the battle of the north bridge which entitled them to a sort of veteran status and we felt that if they employed this tactic it was likely enough the best one 10
 mattathias dover said:   it makes sense
 if we cluster together the redcoats can make an advantage out of it but there's not a blessed thing they can do with two or three of us except chase us and we can outrun them
 that settled it and we broke into parties of two and three 7
 cousin joshua dover decided to remain with the reverend and poor isaac pitt until life passed away- and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world
 i went off with cousin simmons who maintained that if he didn't see to me he didn't know who would
 good heavens adam he said i thought one thing you'd have no trouble learning is when to get out of a place
 i learned that now i said
 we ran east for about half a mile before we turned back to the road panting from the effort and soaked with sweat
 there was a clump of trees that appeared to provide cover right up to the road and the shouting and gunfire never slackened 5
 under the trees there was a dead redcoat a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimples who had taken a rifle ball directly between the eyes
 three men were around him
 they had stripped him of his musket and equipment and now they were pulling his boots and jacket off
 cousin simmons grabbed one of them by the shoulder and flung him away
 god's name what are you to rob the dead with the fight going on! cousin simmons roared
 they tried to outface him but joseph simmons was as wide as two average men and it would have taken braver men than these were to outface him
 that summer the gambling houses were closed despite the threats of pierre ameaux a gaming-card manufacturer
 dancing was no longer permitted in the streets
 the bordel and other places of prostitution were emptied 10
 the slit breeches had to go
 drunkenness was no longer tolerated
 in defiance a chinless reprobate jake camaret marched down the aisle in st peter's one sunday morning followed by one of the women from the bordel whose dress and walk plainly showed the lack of any shame
 plunking themselves down on the front bench they turned to smirk at those around them
 john's first impulse was to denounce their blasphemy 7
 but the thought occurred that god would want this opportunity used to tell them about him
 calmly he opened the bible and read of the woman at the well 6
 he finished the worship service as if there had been no brazen attempt to dishonor god and man
 the next morning as the clock struck nine he appeared at the council meeting in the town hall and insisted that the couple would have to be punished if the church was to be respected
 i have told you before and i tell you again monsieur favre said rudely
 stick to the preaching of the gospel! john stiffened in anger 7
 that is the answer the ungodly will always make when the church points its fingers at their sins
 i say to you that the church will ever decry evil!   john's reply was like a declaration of war
 monsieur favre sat down in his high-backed stall lips compressed eyes glinting
 ablard corne a short man with a rotunda of stomach rose 6
 every eye was on him as he began to speak
 what master calvin says is true
 how can we have a good city unless we respect morality? 13
    abel poupin a tall man with sunken cheeks and deep-set eyes got to his feet
 we all know that jake camaret and the woman are brazenly living together
 it would be well to show the populace how we deal with adulterers 12
 philibert berthelier the son of the famous patriot disagreed 11
 do not listen to that frenchman
 he is throttling the liberty my father gave his life to win!   john was quietly insistent
 there can be no compromise when souls are in jeopardy 13
 a week later the sentence of the council was carried out: jake camaret and the woman were marched naked through the streets past a mocking populace
 before them stalked the beadle proclaiming as he went thus the council deals with those who break its laws- adulterers thieves murderers and lewd persons
 let evildoers contemplate their ways and let every man beware! john's thoughts raced painfully into the past as he read the letter he had just received from his sister mary
 charles had died two weeks before in early november without being reconciled to the church
 the canons in a body had tried to force him on his deathbed to let them give him the last rites of the church but he had died still proclaiming salvation by faith
 burial had taken place at night in the ground at the public crossroads under the gibbet so that his enemies could not find his body and have it dug up and burned
 the abbot of st eloi claude de mommor had been a good friend but not even he thought charles deserved burial in hallowed ground 7
 john closed his eyes and saw once again the little niche in his mother's bedroom where she had knelt to tell the good virgin of her needs
 the blue-draped virgin was still there but no one knelt before her now
 not even varnessa; she too prayed only to god
 for an instant john longed for the sound of the bells of noyon-la-sainte the touch of his mother's hand the lilt of charles's voice in the square raftered rooms his father's bass tones rumbling to the canons and the sight of the beloved bishop
 but he had to follow the light
 unless god expected a man to believe the holy scriptures why had he given them to him? 0
  the white-clad trees stood like specters in the february night
 snow buried the streets and covered the slanting rooftops as john trudged toward st peter's
 a carriage crunched by its dim lights filtering through the gloom 7
 the sharp wind slapped at him and his feet felt like ice as the snow penetrated the holes of his shoes his only ones now patched with folded parchment
 the city had recently given him a small salary but it was not enough to supply even necessities
 as he neared the square a round figure muffled in a long black cape whisked by
 john recognized ablard corne and called out a greeting 7
 how grateful he was to such men! there were several on the council who tried to live like christians
 despite their efforts the problems seemed to grow graver all the time
 quickening his steps john entered the vast church and climbed the tower steps to the bells
 underneath the big one in the silent moonlight lay a dead pigeon and on the smaller bell the clemence two gray and white birds slept huddled together in the cold winter air
 john leaned upon the stone balustrade
 he brushed back his black hair shoving it under his pastor's cap to keep it from blowing in his eyes
 below the moon-splashed world rolled away to insurmountable white peaks; above him the deep blue sky glittered with stars 7
 he stood very still his arms at his sides staring up at the heavens then down at the blinking lights below
 how long my lord? 13
  how long? 18
  i have never asked for an easy task but i am weary of the strife
 sleep was difficult these days
 severe headaches were frequent
 loneliness tore through him like a physical pain whenever he thought of peter robert nerien nicholas cop martin bucer and even the compromising louis du tillet
 an occasional traveler from italy brought news of peter robert who was now distributing his bible among the waldensian peasants 7
 letters came regularly from nerien nicholas and martin 8
 he had anthony and william to confide in and consult 11
 but william continued to find a bitter joy in smashing images and tearing down symbols sacred to the old church
 john found it difficult but he held him in check 9
 and anthony was busy most of the time courting this girl and that 8
 his easy good looks made him a favorite with the ladies 9
 geneva instead of becoming the city of god as john had dreamed had in the two years since he had been there continued to be a godless place where all manner of vice flourished
 refugees poured in signing the confession and rules in order to remain and then disregarding them
 dice rolled prostitutes plied their trade thieves stole murderers stabbed and the ungodly blasphemed
 catholics who were truly christians longed for the simple penance of days gone by
 libertines recalled the heroism of the past and demanded: are we going to allow the protestant pope master calvin to curtail our liberty? 6
  h why oh why doesn't he stick to preaching the gospel instead of meddling in civic affairs politics economics and social issues that are no concern of the church? 6
  and john's reply was always the same: anything that affects souls is the concern of the church! we will have righteousness! tears burned behind his eyes as he prayed and meditated tonight 5
 unless the confusion cleared he would not be coming here much longer
 monsieur favre's threat would become a reality for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city must rid itself of that frenchman 5
 the slow tapping of a cane on the stone steps coming up to the tower interrupted his reverie
 faint at first the tapping grew until it sounded loud against the wind
 what is he doing here at this hour? 14
  he started down the steps to meet the near-blind preacher who had been one of the early gospelers in paris
 john? 19
  is that you? 16
  i came to warn you of a plot!   john stood above him his face ashen
 what now? 15
  slowly like a man grown old he took eli's hand and led him below to the tower study guiding him to a chair beside the little hearth where a fire still burned
 monsieur favre just paid me a visit
 i went to your rooms and anthony told me you were here 9
 two anabaptists caroli and benoit are to challenge you and william to a debate before the council
 it is to be a trap
 you know the law: if you lose the debate after accepting a challenge you will be banished! what will be the subject? 8
    you are to be accused of arianism to confuse the religious who remain loyal
 anger and fear fused in john
 ever since the fourth century a controversy had raged over the person of christ
 those who refused to believe that he was the eternal son of god were termed arianists
 peter caroli had come to geneva saying that he had been a bishop of the church of rome and had been persecuted in paris for his reformed faith
 he asked to be appointed a preacher
 but michael sept had unmasked him revealing he had never been a bishop but was an anabaptist afraid to state his faith because he knew john calvin had written a book against their belief that the soul slept after death
 so john had refused to agree to his appointment as a preacher and now caroli sought revenge
 if william agrees we should insist on a public debate he said at length
 there is more to the conspiracy
 bern demands that the lord's supper be administered here as it used to be with unleavened bread
 furthermore bern decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the council preach only the word of god and stop meddling in politics! it was always the spirit with christ; matters such as leavened or unleavened bread are inconsequential
 geneva must remain a sovereign state
 we will not yield to the demands of bern!   the firelight played over eli's flowing white locks and rugged features 7
 monsieur favre indicated that if i would co-operate after you and william are banished following the debate i will be given a place of influence
 what was your reply to that? 12
  that i would rather be banished with two such christians than be made the chief syndic! the following morning as john entered the place molard on his way to visit a sick refugee he had a premonition of danger
 then suddenly a group of men and dogs circled him 10
 he wanted to run but he knew that if he did he would be lost 15
 he stood very still his heart thumping wildly
 on the outskirts of the rabble the camaret brothers and gaspard favre shook their fists
 are you going to comply with the demands of bern? 10
  the chinless jake called
 arianist! a rowdy with a big blob of a nose roared
 heretic!   john lifted his hand for silence
 know this: the ministers will not yield to the demands of bern 6
 his voice shook a little
 for an instant john was stunned
 when he felt the side of his head his fingers came away covered with blood
 before he could duck another stone struck him
 let him be now! pierre ameaux the gaming-card manufacturer said his little pig eyes glaring
 we have taught him a lesson
 the crowd moved back and john started dizzily down the hill 10
 fis ts pummeled him as he staggered forward
 then he slipped and went down on his hands and knees in the melting snow
 at once a bevy of dogs was snapping and snarling around him 10
 one more horrible than the rest lunged growling deep in his throat his hair bristling
 with great difficulty john clambered to his feet and started to run sweat pouring down his face
 standing in the shelter of the tent- a rejected hospital tent on which the rain now dripped no longer drumming- adam watched his own hands touch the objects on the improvised counter of boards laid across two beef barrels
 there was of course no real need to rearrange everything 15
 a quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake or the toffee or the barley sugar or the sardines or the bitters or the condensed milk or the stationery or the needles- what could it mean? 6
  adam watched his own hands make the caressing anxious movement that when rain falls and nobody comes and ruin draws close like a cat rubbing against the ankles has been the ritual of stall vendors forever
 he knew its meaning
 he had seen a dry old yellowing hand reach out with that painful solicitude to touch to rearrange to shift aimlessly some object worth a pfennig
 back in bavaria he had seen that gesture and at that sight his heart had always died within him
 on such occasions he had not had the courage to look at the face above the hand whatever face it might be
 now the face was his own
 he wondered what expression as he made that gesture was on his face
 he wondered if it wore the old anxiety or the old taut stoicism 9
 but there was no need he remembered for his hand to reach out for his face to show concern or stoicism
 it was nothing to him if rain fell and nobody came 14
 then why was he assuming the role- the gesture and the suffering? 7
  what was he expiating? 11
  or was he now taking the role- the gesture and the suffering- because it was the only way to affirm his history and identity in the torpid befogged loneliness of this land
 he looked out of the tent at the company street 12
 the rain dripped on the freezing loblolly of the street 7
 beyond that misty gray of the rain he saw the stretching hutment low diminutive log cabins chinked with mud with doorways a man would have to crouch to get through with roofs of tenting laid over boughs or boards from hardtack boxes or fence rails with cranky chimneys of sticks and dried mud
 the chimney of the hut across from him was surmounted by a beef barrel with ends knocked out
 in this heavy air however that device did not seem to help 13
 the smoke from that chimney rose as sluggishly as smoke from any other and hung as sadly in the drizzle creeping back down along the sopping canvas of the roof
 over the door was a board with large inept lettering: home sweet home
 this was the hut of simms purdew the hero
 the men were huddled in those lairs
 adam knew the names of some
 he knew the faces of all hairy or shaven old or young fat or thin suffering or hardened sad or gay good or bad
 when they stood about his tent chaffing each other exchanging thei r obscenities cursing command or weather he had studied their faces 6
 he had had the need to understand what life lurked behind the mask of flesh behind the oath the banter the sadness
 once covertly looking at simms purdew the only man in the world whom he hated he had seen the heavy slack bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel obscene banter and had seen the pale-blue eyes go watery with whisky and merriment and suddenly he was not seeing the face of that vile creature
 he was seeing somehow the face of a young boy the boy simms purdew must once have been a boy with sorrel hair and blue eyes dancing with gaiety and the boy mouth grinning trustfully among the freckles 7
 in that moment of vision adam heard the voice within himself saying: i must not hate him i must not hate him or i shall die 5
 his heart suddenly opened to joy
 he thought that if once only once he could talk with simms purdew something about his own life and all life would be clear and simple
 if simms purdew would turn to him and say: adam you know when i was a boy it was a funny thing happened
 lemme tell you now-   if only simms purdew could do that whatever the thing he remembered and told
 it would be a sign for the untellable and he adam would understand
 now adam in the gray light of afternoon stared across at the hut opposite his tent and thought of simms purdew lying in there in the gloom snoring on his bunk with the fumes of whisky choking the air 4
 he saw the sign above the door of the hut: home sweet home 10
 he saw the figure of a man in a poncho coming up the company street with an armful of wood
 it was pullen james the campmate of simms purdew 16
 he carried the wood carried the water did the cooking cleaning and mending and occasionally got a kick in the butt for his pains 5
 adam watched the moisture flow from the poncho
 it gave the rubberized fabric a dull gleam like metal 6
 pullen james humbly lowered his head pushed aside the hardtack-box door of the hut and was gone from sight
 adam stared at the door and remembered that simms purdew had been awarded the medal of honor for gallantry at antietam 5
 the street was again empty
 the drizzle was slacking off now but the light was grayer 7
 with enormous interest adam watched his hands as they touched and shifted the objects on the board directly before him
 into the emptiness of the street and his spirit moved a form 7
 the form was swathed in an army blanket much patched fastened at the neck with a cord
 from under the shapeless huddle of blanket the feet moved in the mud
 the feet wore army shoes in obvious disrepair 11
 the head was wrapped in a turban and on top of the turban rode a great hamper across which a piece of ponc ho had been flung 6
 the gray face stared straight ahead in the drizzle 9
 moisture ran down the cheeks gathered at the tip of the nose and at the chin
 the figure was close enough now for him to see the nose twitching to dislodge the drop clinging there
 the figure stopped and one hand was perilously freed from the hamper to scratch the nose
 then the figure moved on
 this was one of the irish women who had built their own huts down near the river
 adam recognized this one
 he recognized her because she was the one who in a winter twilight on the edge of camp had once stopped him and reached down her hand to touch his fly
 slice o' mutton bhoy? 11
  she had queried in her soft guttural
 slice o' mutton? 13
  her name was mollie
 they called her mollie the mutton and laughed
 looking down the street after her adam saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand from the basket 5
 he could not make out but he knew that again she was scratching her nose
 mollie the mutton was scratching her nose
 the words ran crazily in his head: mollie the mutton is scratching her nose in the rain
 then the words fell into a pattern: mollie the mutton is scratching her nose scratching her nose in the rain
 mollie the mutton is scratching her nose in the rain 8
 the pattern would not stop
 it came again and again
 he felt trapped in that pattern in the repetition
 suddenly he thought he might weep
 what's the matter with me? 6
  he demanded out loud
 he looked wildly around at the now empty street at the mud at the rain
 oh what's the matter with me? 12
  he demanded
 when he had stored his stock in the great oak chest locked the two big hasps and secured the additional chain tied the fly of the tent and picked up the cash box he moved up the darkening street 7
 he would consign the cash box into the hands of jed hawksworth then stand by while his employer checked the contents and the list of items sold
 then he-   then what? 15
  he did not know
 his mind closed on that prospect as though fog had descended to blot out a valley
 far off in the dusk he heard voices singing muffled but strong 7
 in one of the huts a group of men were huddled together singing 21
 he heard the words: rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee! let the water and the blood from thy riven side h   he thought: i am a jew from bavaria
 he was standing there he thought in virginia in the thickening dusk in a costly greatcoat that had belonged to anoth er jew
 that other jew a young man too had left that greatcoat behind in a rich house and marched away
 he had crossed the river which now beyond the woods yonder was sliding darkly under the mist
 he had plunged into the dark woods beyond
 what had that man that other young jew felt as he stood in the twilight and heard other men far away singing together? 6
 
 adam thought of the hutments regiment after regiment row after row the thousands of huts stretching away into the night
 he thought of the men the nameless thousands huddling in them 9
 he thought of simms purdew snoring on his bunk while pullen james crouched by the hearth skirmishing an undershirt for lice and a wet log sizzled
 he thought of simms purdew who once had risen at the edge of a cornfield a maniacal scream on his lips and swung a clubbed musket like a flail to beat down the swirl of rebel bayonets about him 5
 he thought of simms purdew rising up fearless in glory 10
 he felt the sweetness of pity flood through him veining his very flesh
 those men lying in the huts they did not know
 they did not know who they were or know their own worth 10
 in the pity for them his loneliness was gone 13
 then he thought of aaron blaustein standing in his rich house saying: god is tired of taking the blame
 he is going to let history take the blame for a while 17
 he thought of the old man laughing under the glitter of the great chandelier
 he thought: only in my heart can i make the world hang together
 adam rose from the crouch necessary to enter the hut 8
 he saw mose squatting by the hearth breaking up hardtack into a pan
 a pot was boiling on the coals
 done give ole buckra all his money? 9
  mose asked softly
 and look what he done give us
 adam looked at the pot
 what is it? 28
  he asked
 chicken mose said and theatrically licked his lips 9
 gre't big fat chicken yeah
 he licked his lips again
 a chicken with six tits and a tail lak a corkscrew 7
 and hit squealed for slop
 fooled you huh? 10
  it is the same ole same tell me hit's name 21
 it is sowbelly with tits on
 it is salt po'k and skippers
 that po'k it was so full of skippers it would jump and run and not come when you say 'hoo-pig'
 had to put my foot on it to hole it down while i cut it up fer the lob-scuse
 he dumped the pan of crumbled hardtack into the boiling pot of lobscouse
 good ole lob-scuse he mumbled and stirred the pot 9
 he stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder
 know what ole buckra et tonight? 10
  he demanded
 know what i had to fix fer ole him? 8
    adam shook his head
 she was a child too much a part of her environment too eager to grow and learn and experience
 once they were at easthampton for the summer 
 one soft evening- that marvelous sea-blessed time when the sun's departing warmth lingers and a smell of spume and wrack haunts everything- amy had picked herself off the floor and begun to walk 6
 fritzie was on the couch reading; laura was sitting in an easy chair about eight feet away
 the infant in white terry-cloth bathrobe her face intense and purposeful had essayed a few wobbly steps toward her father 7
 y'all wanna walk- walk he said
 then gently he shoved her behind toward laura 11
 amy walked- making it halfway across the cottage floor 6
 she lost not a second picking herself up and continuing her pilgrimage to laura
 then laura took her gently and shoved her off again toward fritzie: amy did not laugh- this was work concentration achievement 5
 in a few minutes she was making the ten-foot hike unaided; soon she was parading around the house flaunting her new skill 9
 some liar's logic a wisp of optimism as fragile as the scent of tropical blossoms that came through the window consoled her for a moment
 amy had to be safe had to come back to them- if only to reap that share of life's experiences that were her due if only to give her parents another chance to do better by her
 through the swathings of terror she jabbed deceit's sharp point- amy would be reborn a new child with new parents living under new circumstances
 the comfort was short-lived yet she found herself returning to the assurance whenever her imagination forced images on her too awful to contemplate without the prop of illusion
 gazing at her husband's drugged body his chest rising and falling in mindless rhythms she saw the grandeur of his fictional world that lush garden from which he plucked flowers and herbs
 she admired him
 in the darkness she saw him stirring
 he seemed to be muttering his voice surprisingly clear 11
 y'all should have let me take that money out andrus said 6
 'nother minute i'd have been fine
 y'all should have let me do it
 yes i know fritzie
 the heat intensified on tuesday
 southern california gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell drier more enervating more laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer past
 it could continue this way hitting 106 and more in the valley joe mcfeeley knew into october
 he and irvin moll were sipping coffee at the breakfast bar 11
 both had been up since 7:00- irv on the early-morning watch mcfeeley unable to sleep during his four-hour relief 6
 the night before they had telephoned the andrus maid selena masters and she had arrived early bursting her vigorous presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused mcfeeley and confounded moll
 the latter thanking her for the coffee had winked and muttered sure 'nuff honey
 selena was the wrong woman for these crudities
 with a hard eye she informed moll: don't sure 'nuff me officer 8
 i'm honey only to my husband understand? 5
  sergeant moll understood
 the maid was very black and very energetic trim in a yellow pique uniform
 her speech was barren of southernisms; she was one of eliot sparling's neutralized minorities adopting the rolling r's and constricted vowels of los angeles
 not seeing her dark intelligent face one would have gauged the voice as that of a westwood village matron ten years out of iowa 8
 after she had served the detectives coffee and toast she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock market quotations
 while she was thus engaged mcfeeley questioned her about her whereabouts the previous day any recollections she had of people hanging around of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen of strange cars cruising the neighborhood
 she answered him precisely missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports
 selena masters joe realized was her own woman
 she was the only kind of negro laura andrus would want around: independent unservile probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework- and doubly efficient
 when the parents emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later the maid greeted them quietly
 i'm awful sorry about what's happened selena said 4
 maybe today'll be a good-news day
 she charged off to the bedrooms
 moll took his coffee into the nursery
 during the night a phone company technician had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones
 someone would have to remain in the office continually 10
 mcfeeley greeted the parents then studied his notebook 7
 he wanted to take the mother to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file
 andrus did not answer him
 his face was bloated with drugging redder than normal 10
 the woman had the glassy look of an invalid as if she had not slept at all
 oh- we managed she said
 did anything happen during the night? 10
    few crank calls mcfeeley said
 a couple of tips we're running down- nothing promising 6
 we can expect more of the same
 too bad your number is in the directory
 didn't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when i had it listed andrus muttered
 he settled on the sofa with his coffee warming his hands on the cup although the room was heavy with heat
 the three had little to say to each other
 the previous night's horror- the absolute failure overcast with the intrusions of the press had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness of play-acting
 sipping their coffee discussing the weather the day's shopping fritzie's commitments at the network they avoided the radio the morning tv news show ev en the front page of the santa luisa register resting on the kitchen bar
 kidnaper spurns ransom; amy still missing
 once andrus walked by it hastily scanned the bold black headline and the five-column lead of the article and muttered: we a buncha national celebrities
 mcfeeley told the parents he would escort them to police headquarters in a half hour
 before that he wanted to talk to the neighbors 13
 he did not want to bring the andruses to the station house too early- rheinholdt had summoned a press conference and he didn't want them subjected to the reporters again
 he could think of nothing else to tell them: no assurances no hopeful hints at great discoveries that day
 when the detective left andrus phoned his secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute director for his current project
 mrs andrus was talking to the maid arranging for her to come in every day instead of the four days she now worked
 outside only a handful of reporters remained
 the bulk of the press corps was covering rheinholdt's conference 14
 in contrast to the caravan of the previous night there were only four cars parked across the street
 two men he did not recognize were sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls
 he did not see sparling or degroot or ringel or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed him twelve hours ago 7
 however the litter remained augmented by several dozen lunchroom suppers
 the street cleaner had not yet been around 10
 one of the reporters called to him: anything new lieutenant? 18
  and he ignored him skirting the parked cars and walking up the path to the skopas house
 when mcfeeley was halfway to the door the proprietor emerged- a mountainous dark man his head thick with resiny black hair his eyes like two of the black olives he imported in boatloads
 the master of the house his nourished face unrevealing consented to postpone his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective 7
 inside as soon as mr skopas had disclosed- in a hoarse whisper- the detective's errand his family gathered in a huddle forming a mass of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of a baroque fireplace
 flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait
 it was amazing how they had herded together for protection: an enormous matriarch in a quilted silk wrapper rising from the breakfast table; a gross boy in his teens shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands; a girl in her twenties fat and sullen descending the marble staircase; then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor
 they answered him in monosyllables nods occasionally muttering in greek to one another awaiting the word from papa who restlessly cracked his knuckles anxious to stuff himself into his white cadillac and burst off to the freeway
 no they hadn't seen anyone around; no they didn't know the andrus family; yes they had read about the case; yes they had let some reporters use their phone but they would no longer
 they offered no opinions volunteered nothing betrayed no emotions 8
 studying them mcfeeley could not help make comparison with the andrus couple
 the skopas people seemed to him of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy
 he imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined whose children had no unhappy romances whose names never knew scandal
 the equation was simple: wealth brought them happiness and their united front to the world was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had let no one in on the secrets
 by comparison fritzie and laura andrus were quivering fledglings 10
 they possessed no outer fortifications no hard shells of confidence; they had enough difficulty getting from day to day let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them
 skopas expressed no curiosity over the case offered no expression of sympathy made no move to escort mcfeeley to the door 6
 all four remained impacted on the sofa until he had left 7
 he had spoken to mrs emerson the previous da y 14
 there remained a family named kahler owners of a two-story tudor-style house on the south side of the andrus home
 their names had not come up in any discussions with laura and he had no idea what they would be like
 mcfeeley noted the immaculate lawn and gardens: each blade of grass cropped bright and firm; each shrub glazed with good health 0
 the door was answered by a slender man in his sixties- straight-backed somewhat clerical in manner wearing rimless glasses 8
 when joe identified himself he nodded unsmiling and ushered him into a sedate living room
 she had a dried-out quality- a gray lean woman not unattractive 11
 both were dressed rather formally
 the man wore a vest and a tie the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands of pearls
 funny thing mr kahler said when they were seated when i heard you ringing i figured it was that guy down the block hausman 5
 kahler continued: i fixed his dog the other day and i guess he's sore so i expected him to come barging in
 mr kahler went on to explain how hausman's fox terrier had been making in his flower beds
 the dog refused to be scared off so kahler had purchased some small firecrackers
 he would lay in wait in the garage and when the terrier came scratching around he'd let fly with a cherry bomb
 scared the hell out of him kahler grinned
 i hit him in the ass once
 both grinned at the detective
 finally all i needed was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker and that dumb dog would run ki- yi-ing for his life
 in the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room and then they went across the hall to the kitchen
 she was intimidated by the stove
 he found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners for her
 the gas flamed up two inches high
 they found the teakettle and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox
 several sections of a loaf of dark bread; butter; jam; a tiny cake of ice
 in their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast china but the wrong table silver they opened every cupboard door in the kitchen and pantry
 while she was settling the teacart he went back across the hall to their bedroom opened one of the suitcases and took out powdered coffee and sugar
 she appeared with the teacart and he opened the windows 10
 do you want to call eugene? 19
  he didn't but it was not really a question and so he left the room walked down the hall to the front of the apartment hesitated and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study 7
 le petit dejeuner harold said in an accent that did credit to miss sloan his high-school french teacher
 at the same time his voice betrayed uncertainty about their being here and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable peace-loving and dependable in everybody
 since ordinary breakfast-table conversation was impossible it was at least something that they were able to offer eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it and the plate of bread and butter and that eugene could return the pitcher of hot milk to them handle first 4
 eugene put a spoonful of powdered coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water
 stirring he said: i am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with you today
 they assured him that they did not expect or need to be entertained
 harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee in his cup and filled it with hot water and then stirring he sat back in his chair 5
 every time he moved or said something the chair creaked again 9
 eugene was not entirely silent or openly rude- unless asking harold to move to another chair and placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act of rudeness
 it went right on creaking under his own considerable weight and all it needed harold thought was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it
 through the open window they heard sounds below in the street: cartwheels a tired horse's plodding step voices
 harold indicated the photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was in
 eugene told him and he promptly forgot
 they passed the marmalade the bread the black-market butter back and forth
 nothing was said about hotels or train journeys
 eugene offered harold his car to use at any time he cared to and when this offer was not accepted the armchair creaked 7
 they all three had another cup of coffee
 eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown and on his large feet he wore yellow turkish slippers that turned up at the toes 6
 ex-cuse me he said in berlitz english and got up and left them to bathe and dress
 the first shrill ring of the telephone brought harold out into the hall
 he realized that he had no idea where the telephone was 10
 at that moment the bathroom door flew open and eugene came out with his face lathered for shaving and strode down the hall tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went
 the telephone was in the study but the ringing came from the hall
 between the telephone and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord and when the conversation came to an end eugene carried the instrument with him the whole length of the apartment to his bathroom where it rang three more times while he was shaving and in the tub 6
 before he left the apartment he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could do for them
 sabine called a few minutes ago eugene said
 she wants you and barbara to have dinner with her tomorrow night 7
 he handed harold a key to the front door and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment 7
 when enough time had elapsed so that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had forgotten harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one room after another 5
 in the room next to theirs was a huge cradle of mahogany ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf
 it was the most important-looking cradle he had ever seen 13
 then came their bathroom and then a bedroom that judging by the photographs on the walls must belong to mme cestre
 a young woman who looked like alix with her two children 8
 alix and eugene on their wedding day
 matching photographs in oval frames of mme bonenfant and an elderly man who must be alix's grandfather
 mme vienot considerably younger and very different 9
 and a gray-haired man whose glance- direct lifelike and mildly accusing- was contradicted by the gilt and black frame 6
 it was the kind of frame that is only put around the photograph of a dead person
 professor cestre could it be? 10
    with the metal shutters closed the dining room was so dark that it seemed still night in there
 one of the drawing-room shutters was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet
 the curtains were of the same material and there were some big oil paintings- portraits in the style of lancret and boucher 9
 though taken individually the big rooms were or seemed to be square the apartment as a whole formed a triangle
 the apex the study where eugene slept was light and bright and airy and cheerful
 the window looked out on the place redoute- it was the only window of the apartment that did
 looking around slowly he saw a marble fireplace a desk a low bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass panes in the doors
 the daybed eugene had slept in made up now with its dark-brown velours cover and pillows
 the portable record player with a pile of classical records beside it
 beethoven's fifth was the one on top
 da- da-da-dum h music could not be eugene's passion 9
 besides the records were dusty
 he tried the doors of the bookcase
 the titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed wires: works on theology astral physics history biology political science
 he moved over to the desk and stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything
 the clock on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room 5
 the concierge called out to them as they were passing through the foyer
 her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building and her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture- a big round oak dining table and chairs a buffet with a row of unclaimed letters inserted between the mirror and its frame
 the suitcases had come while they were out and had been put in their room the concierge said
 he waited until they were inside the elevator and then said: now what do we do? 7
    call the vouillemont i guess
 rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases to be delivered they had gone sight-seeing
 they went to the flea market expecting to find the treasures of europe and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in tours
 cheap clothing and junk of every sort as far as the eye could see 7
 looked at everything
 barbara bought some cotton aprons and harold bought shoestrings 6
 they had lunch at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad busy unpicturesque streets and coming home they got lost in the metro; it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should have changed in order to take the line that went to the place redoute
 it was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole
 when he opened the door there stood eugene on his way out of the apartment
 he was wearing sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt and in his hand he carried a little black bag
 he did not explain where he was going and they did not ask 18
 instead they went on down the hall to their room
 do you think he could be having an affair? 17
  barbara asked as they heard the front door close 6
 oh no harold said shocked
 well this is france after all
 i know but there must be some other explanation 15
 he's probably spending the evening with friends 4
 and for that he needs a little bag? 15
    they went shopping in the neighborhood and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given in blois and some cheese and a dozen eggs and a bag of oranges from a peddler in the place redoute- the first oranges they had seen since they landed 5
 they had vermouth sitting in front of a cafe 19
 when they got home harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment and thought how under different circumstances they might have stayed on here in these old-fashioned high-ceilinged rooms that reminded him of the irelands' apartment in the east eighties 5
 they could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days 7
 he went down the hall to eugene's bathroom to turn on the hot-water heater and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming trunks
 they were damp
 he reached out and felt the bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub
 he looked around the room and then called out: come here quick? 10
  what is it? 10
  barbara asked standing in the doorway
 i've solved the mystery of the little bag
 there it is h and there is what was in it
 but where do people go swimming in paris? 10
  that boat in the river maybe
 what boat? 20
    there's a big boat anchored near the place de la concorde with a swimming pool in it- didn't you notice it? 6
  but if he has time to go swimming he had time to be with us 11
 she looked at him in surprise
 i know he said reading her mind
 i don't know what i'm going to do with you
 it's because we are in france he said and know so few people 7
 so something like this matters more than it would at home 9
 also he was so nice when he was nice
 all because i didn't feel like dancing
 i don't think it was that really
 then what was it? 15
    i don't know
 the tweed coat maybe
 the thing about eugene is that he's very proud
 and the thing about hurt feelings the wet bathing suit pointed out is that the person who has them is not quite the innocent party he believes himself to be
 for instance- what about all those people harold rhodes went toward unhesitatingly as if this were the one moment they would ever have together their one chance of knowing each other? 5
    fortunately the embarrassing questions raised by objects do not need to be answered or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields
 and in any case answers may clarify but they do not change anything
 h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes of about a hundred pounds' weight
 they took jesus's body then and wrapped it in winding-clothes with the spices; that is how the jews prepare a body for burial 5
 listed as present at the descent were mary mary's sister mary magdalene john joseph of arimathea nicodemus
 search as he might he could find no place where the bible spoke of a moment when mary could have been alone with jesus 6
 mostly the scene was crowded with mourners such as the dramatic dell'arca lamentation in bologna where the grief-stricken spectators had usurped mary's last poignant moment
 in his concept there could be no one else present 10
 his first desire was to create a mother and son alone in the universe
 when might mary have had that moment to hold her child on her lap? 6
  perhaps after the soldiers had laid him on the ground while joseph of arimathea was at pontius pilate's asking for christ's body nicodemus was gathering his mixture of myrrh and aloes and the others had gone home to mourn
 those who saw his finished pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses
 they would feel what mary was undergoing
 there would be no halos no angels
 these would be two human beings whom god had chosen 11
 he felt close to mary having spent so long concentrating on the beginning of her journey
 now she was intensely alive anguished; her son was dead 9
 even though he would later be resurrected he was at this moment dead indeed the expression on his face reflecting what he had gone through on the cross
 in his sculpture therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what jesus felt for his mother; only what mary felt for her son
 jesus' inert body would be passive his eyes closed 6
 mary would have to carry the human communication 13
 this seemed right to him
 it was a relief to shift in his mind to technical problems 16
 since his christ was to be life size how was mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship seeming ungainly? 5
  his mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely and convincingly as she would a child
 there was only one way to accomplish this: by design by drawing diagrams and sketches in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas to carry his concept
 he started by making free sketches to loosen up his thinking so that images would appear on paper
 visually these approximated what he was feeling within himself 7
 at the same time he started walking the streets peering at the people passing or shopping at the stalls storing up fresh impressions of what they looked like how they moved
 in particular he sought the gentle sweet-faced nuns with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them down on paper 6
 discovering that draperies could be designed to serve structural purposes he began a study of the anatomy of folds
 he improvised as he went along completing a life-size clay figure then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that argiento brought from the bank of the tiber to the consistency of thick mud
 no fold could be accidental each turn of the drapery had to serve organically to cover the madonna's slender legs and feet so that they would give substantive support to christ's body to intensify her inner turmoil
 when the cloth dried and stiffened he saw what adjustments had to be made
 so that's sculpture commented argiento wryly when he had sluiced down the floor for a week making mud pies
 see argiento if you control the way these folds are bunched like this or made to flow you can enrich the body attitudes 5
 they can have as much tactile appeal as flesh and bone 12
 he went into the jewish quarter wanting to draw hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding of how christ might have looked
 the jewish section was in trastevere near the tiber at the church of san francesco a ripa
 the colony had been small until the spanish inquisition of 1492 drove many jews into rome
 here for the most part they were well treated as a reminder of the old testament heritage of christianity; many of their gifted members were prominent in the vatican as physicians musicians bankers 8
 the men did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio to pose
 he was told to ask for rabbi melzi at the synagogue on saturday afternoon
 michelangelo found the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eyes robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on his head
 he was reading from the talmud with a group of men from his congregation
 when michelangelo explained why he had come rabbi melzi replied gravely:   the bible forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images 6
 that is why our creative people give their time to literature not to painting or sculpture
 but rabbi melzi you don't object to others creating works of art? 6
  not at all
 each religion has its own tenets
 i am carving a pieta from white carrara marble 12
 i wish to make jesus an authentic jew
 i cannot accomplish this if you will not help me 14
 the rabbi said thoughtfully i would not want my people to get in trouble with the church
 i am worki ng for the cardinal of san dionigi 13
 i'm sure he would approve
 what kind of models would you prefer? 15
    workmen
 not bulky laborers but sinewy men
 rabbi melzi smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes 6
 i will send you the best the quarter has to offer 10
 michelangelo hurried to sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seated madonna
 sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle couch 8
 michelangelo bought some scrap lumber
 together he and argiento built the stand covering it with blankets
 his first model arrived at dusk
 he hesitated for a moment when michelangelo asked him to disrobe so michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to wrap around his loins led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes
 he then draped him over the rough stand explained that he was supposed to be recently dead and was being held on his mother's lap 6
 the model quite plainly thought michelangelo crazy; only the instructions from his rabbi kept him from bolting
 but at the end of the sitting when michelangelo showed him the quick free drawings with the mother roughed in holding her son the model grasped what michelangelo was after and promised to speak to his friends h
 he worked for two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi 0
 mary presented quite a different problem
 though this sculpture must take place thirty-three years after her moment of decision he could not conceive of her as a woman in her mid-fifties old wrinkled broken in body and face by labor or worry 6
 his image of the virgin had always been that of a young woman even as had his memory of his mother
 jacopo galli introduced him into several roman homes 9
 here he sketched sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk young girls not yet twenty some about to be married some married a year or two
 since the santo spirito hospital had taken only men he had had no experience in the study of female anatomy; but he had sketched the women of tuscany in their fields and homes
 he was able to discern the body lines of the roman women under their robes
 he spent concentrated weeks putting his two figures together: a mary who would be young and sensitive yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap; and a jesus who though lean was strong even in death h a look he remembered well from his experience in the dead room of santo spirito
 he drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory without need to consult his sketches
 soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay
 here he would have free expression because the material could be moved to distort forms
 when he wanted to emphasize or get greater intensity he added or subtracted clay
 next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence
 he respected ea ch of these approach techniques and kept them in character: his quill drawings had a scratchiness suggesting skin texture; the clay he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh as in an abdomen in a reclining torso; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an elastic pull
 yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his mind; they remained rough starting points
 when carving he was charged with spontaneous energy; too careful or detailed studies in clay and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model
 the true surge had to be inside the marble itself
 drawing and models were his thinking
 the arrangement with argiento was working well except that sometimes michelangelo could not figure who was master and who apprentice
 argiento had been trained so rigorously by the jesuits that michelangelo was unable to change his habits: up before dawn to scrub the floors whether they were dirty or not; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry every day the pots scoured with river sand after each meal
 argiento this is senseless he complained not liking to work on the wet floors particularly in cold weather
 scrub the studio once a week
 before dawn
 and god help anyone who tries to unteach you! grumbled michelangelo; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble about for argiento made few demands on him
 the boy was becoming acquainted with the contadini families that brought produce into rome
 on sundays he would walk miles into the campagna to visit with them and in particular to see their horses
 the one thing he missed from his farm in the po valley was the animals; frequently he would take his leave of michelangelo by announcing:   today i go see the horses
 it took a piece of bad luck to show michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him
 he was crouched over his anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim when a splinter of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil
 he stumbled into the house eyes burning like fire 11
 argiento made him lie down on the bed brought a pan of hot water dipped some clean white linen cloth and applied it to extract the splinter
 though the pain was considerable michelangelo was not too concerned
 he assumed he could blink the splinter out 10
 but it would not come
 argiento never left his side keeping the water boiled applying hot compresses throughout the night
 by the second day michelangelo began to worry; and by the second night he was in a state of panic: he could see nothing out of the afflicted eye
 at dawn argiento went to jacopo galli
 galli arrived with his family surgeon maestro lippi 8
 the surgeon carried a cage of live pigeons
 he told argiento to take a bird out of the cage cut a large vein under its wing let the blood gush into michelangelo's injured eye 7
 the surgeon came back at dusk cut the vein of a second pigeon again washed out the eye
 beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps 7
 the thin legs twitched convulsively once then kate felt the little body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound 5
 the scant flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands 10
 when juanita awoke kate was still rocking the dead child still crooning in disbelief no no oh no!   they put kate to bed and wired jonathan and sent for the young presbyterian minister 5
 he sat beside kate's bed with the others throughout the morning talking talking of god's will while kate lay staring angrily at him 7
 when he told her god had called the child to him she rejected his words rebelliously
 few of the neighbors came but mrs tussle came called by tragedy
 it always comes in threes she sighed heavily 11
 trouble never comes but in threes
 they held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot 5
 kate moved through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment
 she would not accept the death of such a little child 10
 god called her to him the minister had said
 god would not do that kate thought stubbornly
 jonathan's letter came as she knew it would and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment from god against both kate and himself
 in blind panic of grief she accepted jonathan's dictum and believed in her desperation that she had been cursed by god 6
 she held jonathan's letter his words burning like a brand and knew suddenly that the bonds between them were severed 7
 she had nothing left but her duty to his land and his son 7
 joel came and sat mutely with her sharing her pain and anguish averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom
 juanita and mrs tussle kept kate in bed a week until her milk dried
 when she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion save dedication to duty
 she disciplined herself daily to do what must be done 7
 she had even steeled herself to keep juanita upstairs in the nurse's room off the empty nursery although the girl tried to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare kate remembrance of the baby's death
 juanita drooped about the place wearing a haunted brooding look which kate attributed to the baby's death until the day a letter came for her addressed to miss juanita fitzroy bearing a grafton postmark
 seeing the slanting hand kate knew uneasily that it was from the yankee colonel
 the federal forces had taken parkersburg and grafton from the rebels and were moving to take all the mountains
 kate tried to contain her curiosity and foreboding at what the letter portended at what involvement existed for juanita 6
 uncle randolph and joel had replanted the bottom lands with difficulty for more of the slaves including annie had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp
 joel worked like a field hand in the afternoons after school 8
 he had been at lessons in the schoolhouse since they returned from harpers ferry
 kate felt she had deserted the boy in her own loss 7
 she loved him and missed his company
 uncle randolph had been riding out every evening on so me secret business of his own
 what it was kate could not fathom
 he claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play cards and drink with his cronies but kate had not smelled brandy on him since mrs lattimer's funeral
 joel knew what he was about however
 you're gonna get caught she heard joel say to uncle randolph by the pump one morning
 not this old fox chuckled uncle randolph
 everybody knows i'm just a harmless deaf old man who takes to drink
 i aim to keep a little whisky still back in the ridge for my pleasure
 whisky still my foot said joel
 you're back there riding with the guerrillas the moccasin rangers 5
 hush said uncle randolph smiling or i'll give you another black eye
 he patted the eye joel had had blackened in a fight over being rebel at the crossroads some days back
 kate had no idea what they were talking of although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires burning and winking on the ridges at night had heard horsemen on the river road and hill trails through the nights till dawn
 stranger uncle randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle drunkenly singing old dan tucker at the top of his voice
 hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road kate would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house cold sober
 what he was about became clear to her with the circulation of another broadside proclamation by general mcclellan threatening reprisals against rebel guerrillas
 she was taken up in worry for the reckless old man 11
 kate drew more and more on her affection for joel through the hot days of summer work
 she had taken him out of the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer after she saw miss snow crack joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake loose in the schoolroom
 kate had walked past the school on her morning chores and had seen the whole incident had seen joel's burning humiliation before miss snow's cold bespectacled wrath
 he had the hardest pains of growing before him now as he approached twelve
 these would be his hardest years she knew and he missed his father desperately
 she tried to find some way to draw him out to help him 9
 whenever she found time she went blackberry picking with him and they would come home together mouths purple arms and faces scratched tired enough to forget grief for another day 5
 he tended the new colts beau had sired
 he helped kate and juanita enlarge the flower garden in the side yard where they sometimes sat in the still evenings watching the last fat bees working against the summer's purple dusk
 no one went much to the crossroads now except uncle randolph 11
 they stayed in their own world on the bluff waiting for letters and the peddler bringing the news
 jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction of harpers ferry before they abandoned it; of their first engagement at falling waters after old jack's first brigade had destroyed all the rolling stock of the b+o railroad
 the men were restive he wrote ready to take the battle to the enemy as jackson wished
 the peddler came bawling his wares and told them of the convention in wheeling which had formed a new state government by declaring the government at richmond in the east illegal because they were traitors 6
 dangling his gaudy trinkets before them he told of the rebel losses in the mountains at cheat and rich mountains both and the federal march on beverly
 cleaned all them rebs out'n the hills they did! they won't never git over inter loyal western virginia them traitors! the federals is making everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too he crowed
 after he had gone kate asked uncle randolph proudly would you take their oath? 8
    and the old man had given a sly and wicked laugh and said hell yes! i think i've taken it about fifty times already! winking at joel's look of shock
 her mother wrote kate of her grief at the death of kate's baby and at jonathan's decision to go with the south and dear kate she wrote poor dr breckenridge's son robert is now organizing a militia company to go south to his good father's sorrow
 maj anderson of fort sumter is home and recruiting volunteers for the us army
 in spite of the fact that the state legislature voted us neutral john hunt morgan is openly flying the confederate flag over his woolen factory!   rumor of a big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley 7
 accounts were garbled at the telegraph office when they sent old george down to parkersburg for the news
 all dey know down dere is it were at manassas junction and it were a big fight the old man told them
 in the next few days they had cause to rejoice
 it had been a big battle and the confederate forces had won 9
 jonathan and ben were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing
 kate and mrs tussle waited for letters anxiously 7
 joel went to the crest of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate
 when kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out she saw other dots of flames among the western virginia hills from the few scattered fires of the faithful
 they all prayed now that the north would realize that peace must come for virginia had defended her land victoriously 8
 the week after manassas the sound of horses in the yard brought kate up in shock from an afternoon's rest when she saw the federal soldiers from her upstairs window
 they had already lost most of their corn she thought 13
 were they to be insulted again because of the south's great victory? 5
  she remembered mcclellan's last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs
 at the landing she saw juanita her face flushed pink with excitement run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door 7
 juanita stopped just inside the open door her hand to her mouth 8
 as kate came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw colonel marsh framed in the doorway his face set in the same vulnerable look juanita wore
 kate greeted him gravely uneasy with misgivings at his visit 7
 what brings you here again colonel marsh? 9
  she asked taking him and juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed against the afternoon sun
 i stopped to say goodbye mrs lattimer and to tell you how sorry i was to hear about your baby
 i wish our doctor could have saved her
 it was a terrible loss to me said kate quietly feeling the pain twist again at the mention knowing now that juanita must have written to him at grafton
 where will you go now that you're leaving parkersburg? 9
  she asked him seeing juanita's eyes grow bleak 6
 as you know general mcclellan has been occupying beverly 8
 he has notified me that he has orders to go to washington to take over the army of the potomac
 i am to go to washington to serve with him
 when are you to leave? 12
  kate asked watching them both now anxiously
 their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions she thought sadly 6
 would you permit juanita to walk about the grounds with me for a short spell mrs lattimer? 9
  stay here in the parlor where it's cool she said trying to be calm
 it would be better for joel and uncle randolph and mrs tussle not to see them
 kate went back and reminded the kitchen women of the supper preparations
 then she took iced lemonade to marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees around the flower garden
 when marsh called to his aide and the pair rode off down the river road where the gentians burned blue juanita was shaken and trying not to cry
 she sought kate out upstairs her lips trembling 11
 he wants me to go with him tomorrow she told kate 13
 what do you want to do? 31
  kate asked uneasy at the gravity of the girl's dilemma 6
 i could go with him
 he knows me as your niece which of course i am
 but i am a slave! you own me
 it's your decision said juanita holding her face very still trying to contain the bitterness of her voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly
 no the decision is yours
 i have held your papers of manumission since i married mr lattimer
 the red glow from the cove had died out of the sky 9
 the two in the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they have shared the same bed for many years and they needed to say no more
 the things left unsaid they both felt deeply and with a sigh they fell back on the well-stuffed pillows
 anita put out the remaining candles with a long snuffer and in the smell of scented candlewick the comforting awareness of each other's bodies the retained pattern of dancers and guests remembered their minds grew numb and then empty of images
 they slept- mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched snoring the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table 7
 in the ballroom below the dark had given way to moonlight coming in through the bank of french windows
 it was a delayed moon but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared the silver-gray sky
 martha schuyler old slow careful of foot came down the great staircase dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk her jeweled shoe buckles held forward
 well i'm here at last she said addressing the old portraits on the walls
 i don't hear the music
 i am getting deaf i must admit it
 she came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that led down to it
 where is everyone? 17
  i say where is everyone? 15
  peter you lummox you've forgot to order the musicians 8
 she stood there a large old woman smiling at the things she would say to him in the morning this big foolish baby of a son 6
 there were times now like this when she lost control of the time count and moved freely back and forth into three generations 10
 was it a birthday ball? 13
  when peter had reached his majority at eighteen? 8
  or was it her own first ball as mistress of this big house a van rensselaer bride from way upstate near albany from rensselaerwyck 5
 and this handsome booby staring and sweating was he her bridegroom? 11
    martha picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom 4
 david cortlandt was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh 8
 he had ridden hard from boston and he was not used to horseback 10
 now driving the horse and sulky borrowed from mynheer schuyler he felt as if eve ry bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move
 the road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls and wood gods rather than the hudson river valley of his boyhood memories
 he slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse and held on as the sulky's wheels hit a pothole and came out with a jolt and went on
 he would cross to manhattan to harlem heights before morning 10
 there a certain farmhouse was a station for the sons of liberty 11
 he would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches with their electrifying news
 and he would sleep sleep and never think of roads and horses' sore haunches of colonial wars
 strange how everything here fitted back into his life even if he had been away so long
 mynheer sir francis the valley society the very smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish weirs and rocks and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road
 a mist was walking on the water white as cotton but with a blending and merging grace
 ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement at a crossroads 9
 david reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags at his feet
 he pulled out one of them and cocked it
 a strange wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes
 it was a grotesque hen five or six feet tall 14
 it had the features of a man bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers
 it ran this apocalyptic beast on two thin legs and its wings- were they feathered arms? 9
 - flapped as it ran
 black strips of skin hung from it
 the horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its nostrils 8
 david took a firm hand with it
 the creature in feathers looked around and david saw the mad eyes glazed with an insane fear
 the ungainly bird thing ran away and to david its croaking sounded like the crowing of a tormented rooster
 he drove on wary and shaken
 the sons were out tonight
 new york lay bleaching in the summer sun and the morning fish hawk flying in the heated air saw below him the long triangular wedge of manhattan island
 it was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens and laid out into pig-infested streets mostly around the battery going bravely north to wall street but giving up and becoming fields and farms in the region of harlem heights
 from there it looked across at westchester county and the hudson river where the manor houses estates and big farms of the original landowners began
 on the east side of the island of manhattan the indifferent hawk knew the east river that connected new york bay with long island sound
 on the western tip of long island protruded brooklyn heights 10
 it commanded a view over manhattan and the harbor 12
 a fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights and behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields 6
 husbandry was bounded by snake-rail fences and there were grazing cattle
 on the shores north and south the fishers and mooncursers- smugglers- lived along the churning great south bay and the narrow barrier of sand fire island
 the morning hawk hungry for any eatable killable digestible item kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships that lay off the shores in the bay sheltered by the jersey inlets
 they often threw tidbits overboard
 the larger ships were near paulus hook already being called by a few jersey city
 these were the ships of his majesty's navy herding the hulks of the east indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists 5
 the news of battle on breed's hill had already seeped through and new york itself was now left in the hands of the local provincial congress
 the fish hawk his wings not moving circled and glided lower 7
 the gilt sterns of the men- of-war becoming clearer to him the sides of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black the bronze cannon at the ports
 the captain's gig of hms mercury was being rowed to hms neptune 7
 on shore the freed slaves to despotism- the town dwellers- watched the ships and waite d
 the chevaux de frise those sharp stakes and barriers around the fort at the battery pointed to a conflict between the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came in
 across the bay the palisades were heavy in green timber; their rock paths led down to the hudson
 below in the open bay facing manhattan was staten island gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind which nested farms cattle barns and berry thickets
 along wappinger creek in dutchess county past the white church at fishkill past verplanck's point on the east bank of the hudson to the white salt-crusted roads of the long island rockaways there was a watching and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen
 today tomorrow six months even perhaps a year h   the fish hawk flew on and was lost from sight
 the british ships rolled at anchor sent out picket boats and waited for orders from london
 waited for more ships more lobster-backed infantry and asked what was to be done with a war of rebellion? 6
  david cortlandt having slept away a day and a night came awake in a plank farmhouse on the harlem river near spuyten duyvil 6
 he looked out through windowpanes turned a faint violet by sun and weather looked out at king's bridge toward westchester
 the road seemed animated with a few mo re wagons than usual; a carriage raising up the choking june dust and beyond in a meadow a local militia company drilling with muskets kentuck' rifles every kind of horse pistol old sword or cutlass
 the wraith-like events of the last few days flooded david's mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from boston
 he had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper people and had slept
 now there was more to do
 orders not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government
 he scratched his mosquito-plagued neck
 from the saddlebags hung on a hitchcock chair david took out a good english razor a present from john hunter
 he found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of soap and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his broad leather belt its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost h
 he hoped he was free of self-deception
 here he was suddenly caught up in the delirium of a war in the spite and calumny of whigs and tories
 there would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war
 david cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion was not wholly what it appeared on the surface 5
 he knew that many were using it for their own ends 15
 but it did not matter
 he stropped the razor slowly; what mattered was that a new concept of americans was being born
 that some men did not want it he could understand
 the moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers
 yet some like morris manderscheid would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas
 unique circumstances would test us all he decided
 injury and ingratitude would occur
 no doubt john hancock would do well now; war was a smugglers' heaven
 and what of that poor tarred and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from schuyler's? 7
  things like that would increase rather than be done away with 8
 one had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss of nothing
 he saw with john hunter now that the perfectability of man was a dream
 life was a short play of tenebrous shadows
 david began to shave with great sweeping strokes
 time plays an essential part in our mortality and suddenly for no reason he could imagine the image of peg laughing filled his mind- so desirable so lusty so full of nuances of pleasure and joy 5
 he drove sensual patterns off carefully shaving his long upper lip 10
 it is harder he muttered to meditate on man than on god 10
 david finished shaving washed his face clean of lather and combed and retied his hair
 he was proud that he had never worn a wig
 more and more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder
 he felt cheerful again refreshed; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit the well-made riding boots
 it is so easy to falsify sentiment h
 in the meadow below militia officers shouted at their men and on king's bridge two boys sat fishing
 the future would happen; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much
 a man could be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days
 he began to pack the saddlebags
 and all this too shall pass away: it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church service when he was a boy- yes in a white church with a thin spur steeple in the patriarchal hudson valley where a feeling of plenitude was normal in those english-dutch manors with their well-fed squires
 burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on in a primitive way almost unchanged from feudal times 6
 he wondered how they could go on in poverty superstition ignorance with a complete lack of desire to make either their land or their lives flourish
 andrei remembered a bathyran meeting long ago
 tolek alterman had returned from the colonies in palestine and before the national leadership exalted the miracles of drying up swamps and irrigating the desert
 a fund-raising drive to buy tractors and machinery was launched 9
 andrei remembered that his own reaction had been one of indifference
 had he found the meaning too late? 11
  it aggravated him
 the land of the lublin uplands was rich but no one seemed to care
 in the unfertile land in palestine humans broke their backs pushing will power to the brink
 he had sat beside alexander brandel at the rostrum of a congress of zionists
 all of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified ideologies and each berated the other and beat his breast for his own approaches
 when alexander brandel rose to speak the hall became silent 11
 i do not care if your beliefs take you along a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism
 we are here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest seeking human dignity
 beyond the forest all our paths merge into a single great highway which ends in the barren eroded hills of judea
 this is our singular goal
 how we travel through the forest is for each man's conscience 7
 where we end our journey is always the same
 we all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses which will continue to plague us until the star of david flies over zion
 this was how alexander brandel expressed pure zionism 13
 it had sounded good to andrei but he did not believe it 12
 in his heart he had no desire to go to palestine 13
 he loathed the idea of drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright
 before he went into battle andrei had told alex i only want to be a pole
 warsaw is my city not tel aviv
 and now andrei sat on a train on the way to lublin and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack of belief 10
 warsaw! he saw the smug eyes of the home army chief roman and all the romans and the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him 5
 they had let this black hole of death in warsaw's heart exist without a cry of protest
 once there had been big glittering rooms where ulanys bowed and kissed the ladies' hands as they flirted from behind their fans 6
 i am a jew
 day by day week by week month by month the betrayal gnawed at andrei's heart
 he ground his teeth together
 i hate warsaw he said to himself
 i hate poland and all the goddamned mothers' sons of them 11
 all of poland is a coffin
 the terrible vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind 11
 what matters now? 16
  what is beyond this fog? 10
  only palestine and i will never live to see palestine because i did not believe
 by late afternoon the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at lublin which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war to the russian front
 at a siding another train which was a familiar sight these days 8
 andrei's skilled eye sized them up
 he guessed by their appearance that they were rumanians 9
 he walked toward the center of the city to keep his rendezvous with styka
 of all the places in poland andrei hated lublin the most 9
 the bathyrans were all gone
 few of the native jews who had lived in lublin were still in the ghetto
 from the moment of the occupation lublin became a focal point 12
 he and ana watched it carefully
 lublin generally was the forerunner of what would happen elsewhere
 early in 1939 odilo globocnik the gauleiter of vienna established ss headquarters for all of poland
 the bathyrans ran a check on globocnik and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war with hans frank and the civil ian administrators
 globocnik built the death's-head corps
 lublin was the seed of action for the final solution of the jewish problem
 as the messages from himmler heydrich and eichma nn came in through alfred funk lublin's fountainhead spouted
 a bevy of interlacing lagers work camps concentration camps erupted in the area
 sixty thousand jewish prisoners of war disappeared into lublin's web
 plans went in and out of lublin indicating german confusion 11
 a tale of a massive reservation in the uplands to hold several million jews h a tale of a plan to ship all jews to the island of madagascar h stories of the depravity of the guards at globocnik's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention of their names 4
 lipowa 7 sobibor chelmno poltawa belzec krzywy-rog budzyn krasnik 8
 ice baths electric shocks lashings wild dogs testicle crushers
 the death's-head corps took in ukrainian and baltic auxiliaries and the einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken dope-ridden maniacs
 in the spring of 1942 operation reinhard began in lublin 14
 the ghetto a miniature of warsaw's was emptied into the camp in the majdan-tartarski suburb called majdanek
 as the camp emptied it was refilled by a draining of the camps and towns around lublin then by deportees from outside poland 6
 in and in and in they poured through the gates of majdanek but they never left and majdanek was not growing any larger 7
 what was happening in majdanek? 16
  was operation reinhard the same pattern for the daily trains now leaving the umschlagplatz in warsaw? 7
  was there another majdanek in the warsaw area as they suspected? 7
    andrei stopped at litowski place and looked around quickly at the boundary of civil buildings
 his watch told him he was still early
 down the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall 12
 he found an empty bench opened a newspaper and stretched his legs before him
 krakow boulevard was filled with black nazi uniforms and the dirty brownish ones of their auxiliaries
 captain androfski! andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the mustached homely face of sergeant styka 7
 styka sat beside him and pumped his hand excitedly 8
 i have been waiting across the street at the post office since dawn
 i thought you might get in on a morning train 12
 it's good to see you again styka
 he almost broke into tears
 to him andrei androfski had always been the living symbol of a polish officer
 his captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn and shabby
 remember to call me jan andrei said
 styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously 8
 when that woman found me and told me that you needed me i was never so happy since before the war
 i'm lucky that you were still living in lublin 5
 for a time i thought of trying to reach the free polish forces but one thing led to another
 i got a girl in trouble and we had to get married 10
 so we have three children and responsibilities
 i work at the granary
 nothing like the old days in the army but i get by 10
 who complains? 23
  many times i tried to reach you but i never knew how 9
 i came to warsaw twice but there was that damned ghetto wall h   i understand
 styka blew his nose again
 were you able to make the arrangements? 11
  andrei asked
 there is a man named grabski who is the foreman in charge of the bricklayers at majdanek
 i did exactly as instructed
 i told him you are on orders from the home army to get inside majdanek so you can make a report to the government in exile in london 9
 his answer? 15
    ten thousand zlotys
 can he be trusted? 13
    he is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours if he betrays you
 captain h jan h must you go inside majdanek? 7
  the stories h everyone really knows what is happening there 10
 what good will it really do? 11
    i don't know
 perhaps h perhaps h there is a shred of conscience left in the human race
 perhaps if they know the story there will be a massive cry of indignation
 do you really believe that jan? 10
    i have to believe it
 styka shook his head slowly
 i am only a simple soldier
 i cannot think things out too well
 until i was transferred into the seventh ulanys i was like every other pole in my feeling about jews
 i hated you when i first came in
 but h my captain might have been a jew but he wasn't a je w 9
 what i mean is he was a pole and the greatest soldier in the ulanys
 the men of our company had a dozen fights defending your name 10
 you never knew about it but by god we taught them respect for captain androfski
 since the war i have seen the way the germans have behaved and i think holy mother we have behaved like this for hundreds of years 8
 why? 15
    how can you tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see? 9
    but we are neither blind nor insane
 the men of your company would not allow your name dishonored 13
 why do we let the germans do this? 8
  i have sat many hours with this styka
 all i ever wanted was to be a free man in my own country 8
 i used to love this country and believe that someday we'd win our battle for equality
 but now i think i hate it very much
 and do you really think that the world outside poland will care any more than we do? 8
    the question frightened andrei
 please don't go inside majdanek
 i'm still a soldier in a very small way styka
 it was an answer that styka understood
 grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge over the river bystrzyca near the rail center
 grabski sat in a sweat-saturated undershirt cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy stillness before sundown
 he was a square brick of a man with a moon-round face and sunken polish features
 flies swarmed around the bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread
 half of it dripped down his chin
 he washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated belch 10
 grabski looked at the pair of them
 he grunted a sort of yes answer
 my cousin works at the labor bureau
 he can make you work papers
 it will take a few days
 i will get you inside the guard camp as a member of my crew 9
 i don't know if i can get you into the inner camp
 maybe yes maybe no but you can observe everything from the roof of a barrack we are building
 grabski slurped his way to the bottom of the soup bowl 8
 can't understand why the hell anyone wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place
 orders from the home army
 why? 19
  nothing there but jews
 well- what about the money? 11
    andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty notes 8
 grabski had never seen so much money
 his broad flat fingers petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying snatched the bills clumsily
 you get the rest when i'm safely out of majdanek 8
 i ain't taking no goddamned chances for no jew business 8
 andrei and styka were silent
 she was getting real dramatic
 i'd have been more impressed if i hadn't remembered that she'd played hedda gabler in her highschool dramatics course
 i didn't want her back on that broken record 6
 nothing's free in the whole goddam world was all i could think of to say
 when i'd delivered myself of that gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink
 i'd forgotten all about thelma and the kentucky derby and how it was thelma's fifty dollars i was spending
 it was just me and eileen getting drunk together like we used to in the old days and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my hands on her partly because i wanted to wring her neck because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch 5
 drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me
 i was crazy about her all over again
 it was the call of the wild all right
 that evening turned out to be hell like all the others 10
 we moved down broadway from ginmill to ginmill
 it was the same old routine
 eileen got to dancing just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed tune that you could hardly notice and trying to pick up strange men but each time i was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together and there i was back on the hook
 i did have the decency to call up thelma and tell her i'd met old friends and would be home late
 i could scratch her eyes out eileen cried and stamped her foot when i came back from the phone booth
 you know i don't like my men to have other women 10
 i hate it
 she got so drunk i had to take her home
 it was a walk up on hudson street
 she just about made me carry her upstairs and then she clung to me and wouldn't let me go
 there was a man's jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table
 the place smelt of some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use
 what about ballestre? 25
  i had to shake her to make her listen
 what about him? 20
    suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic
 precious and i allow each other absolute freedom
 we are above being jealous
 he's used to me bringing home strange men
 i'll just tell him you're my husband
 he can't object to that
 if he pokes his nose in here i'll slug him
 that really would be funny
 she was still laughing when i grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed
 after all i'm made of flesh and blood
 i'm not a plaster saint
 never in my life have i felt so remorseful about anything i've done as i did about spending that night with my own wife
 eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the pillow 6
 she lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling me where to look for the coffeepot 7
 i was stumbling in my undershirt trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when i smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell 6
 there was somebody else in the apartment
 honest i could feel the hair stand up on the back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight
 i turned around with the percolator in my hand 10
 my eyes were so bleary i could barely see him but there he was a little smooth olivefaced guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora
 oval face without an expression in the world 10
 we didn't have time to speak before eileen's voice was screeching at us from the bed
 joseph maria ballestre meet francis xavier bowman 9
 she gave the nastiest laugh i ever heard
 and don't either of you forget that i'm not any man's property 9
 if you want to fight go down on the sidewalk 16
 she was enjoying the situation
 eileen was a psychologist all right
 instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard i found myself having a fellowfeeling for him
 maybe he felt the same way
 i never felt such a lowdown hound in my life 11
 first thing i knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and i was handing eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a queen among her courtiers
 i couldn't face thelma after that night
 i didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone 6
 i wrote her that i'd met up with eileen and that old bonds had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express 6
 of course i had to give her eileen's address but she never came near us
 all she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and it was goodbye forever
 she never said a word about the fifty dollars 10
 she added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking 10
 i must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times
 afterwards i learned that eileen had called thelma on the telephone and made a big scene about thelma trying to take her husband away 6
 that finished me with thelma
 trust eileen to squeeze all the drama out of a situation 8
 and there i was shacked up with eileen in that filthy fourth floor attic on hudson street
 i use the phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship
 i felt it and it ate on me all the time but i didn't know how right i was till later
 what i did know was that precious was always around 12
 he slept in the hall bedroom at the head of the stairs 7
 who do you think pays the rent? 13
  you wouldn't have me throw the poor boy out on the street eileen said when i needled her about it
 i said sure that was what i wanted her to do but she paid no attention
 eileen had a wonderful way of not listening to things she didn't want to hear
 still i didn't think she was twotiming me with precious right then
 to be on the safe side i never let eileen get out of my sight day or night
 i couldn't make out what his racket was
 i'd thought him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be 5
 he was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his selfeffacing manner
 still he let eileen treat him like a valet
 whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was precious who did the work
 i never could find out what his business was 11
 he always seemed to have money in his pocket 14
 the phone had been disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger
 now and then he would disappear for several days
 connections was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when i put leading questions
 oh he's just an international spy eileen would shout with her screechy laugh
 poor devil he can't have been too happy either 7
 he got no relief from drink because though sometimes precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the evening he'd leave it on the table untouched
 when i was in liquor i rode him pretty hard i guess 9
 occasionally if i pushed him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of his
 some day i told eileen that guy will kill us both 7
 getting drunk every night was the only way i could handle the situation
 eileen seemed to feel the same way
 we still had that much in common
 the trouble was drinking cost money
 the way eileen and i were hitting it up we needed ten or fifteen dollars an evening
 eileen must have wheedled a little out of precious 6
 i raised some kale by hocking the good clothes i had left over from my respectable uptown life but when that was gone i didn't have a cent
 i don't know what we would have done if pat o'dwyer hadn't come to town
 pat o'dwyer looked like a heavier jim
 he had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't have jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm
 he was a big thick beefy violent man
 now pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly but he was a good churchgoing catholic and he loved his little sister 7
 those o'dwyers had that irish clannishness that made them stick together in spite of politics and everything
 pat took eileen and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again
 whom god hath joined etcetera
 the o'dwyers were real religious people except for kate 8
 now it would be up to me to keep the little girl out of mischief 11
 pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost her job on that fashion magazine
 it had gone big with the hollywood girls when he told them his sister was an editor of art and apparel
 how about me trying to help her get her job back? 8
    all evening eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready for her first communion
 it just about blew us both out of the water when eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with
 but brother i can't take a job right now she said with her eyes on her ice cream i'm going to have a baby francis xavier's baby my own husband's baby
 my first thought was how had it happened so soon but i counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd been living together six weeks 5
 pat meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment
 greatest thing that ever happened
 now eileen really would have to settle down to love honor and obey and she'd have to quit drinking
 he'd come east for the christening by god he would 6
 when we separated that evening pat pushed a hundred dollar bill into eileen's hand to help towards a layette
 before he left town pat saw to it that i was fixed up with a job 9
 pat had contacts all over the labor movement
 a friend of pat's named frank sposato had just muscled into the portwatchers' union
 the portwatchers were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves 7
 most of them were elderly men
 it was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because the thieving is awful in the port of new york
 they weren't as well paid as they should have been 8
 one reason the portwatchers let sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen
 sposato needed a front some labor stiff with a clean record to act as business agent of the redhook local
 there i was a retired wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow worker in my thirty years in the movement 8
 for once radicalism was a recommendation 11
 sposato couldn't wait to get me hired
 with my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance i certainly looked the honest working stiff
 the things a man will do for a woman
 there was one fact which rector could not overlook one truth which he could not deny
 as long as there were two human beings working together on the same project there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave
 no matter how devoted a man was no matter how fully he gave his life to the lord he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition as an individual
 all of the jobs in the mission might be equal in the eyes of the lord but they were certainly not equal in the eyes of the lord's servants
 it was only natural that fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decisions
 even rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he knew it not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church- his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career- but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel
 he was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church and how much was his own ego demanding to be satisfied for the two were intertwined and could not be separated 5
 he wanted desperately to see kayabashi defeated the communists in the village rooted out the mission standing triumphant for in the triumph of the lord he himself would be triumphant too
 but perhaps this was a part of the eternal plan that man's ambition when linked with god would be a driving indefatigable force for good in the world
 how foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice
 he would have to work without questioning the motives which made him work and content himself with the thought that the eventual victory however it was brought about would be sweet indeed
 his first move was to send hino to the village to spend a few days 7
 his arm had been giving him some trouble and rector was not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print shop using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse
 in any event rector sent him to the local hospital to have it checked telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find out what kayabashi was planning
 hino was elated at the prospect
 he was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital and he was given some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor- an excellent place to make contact with the enemy
 he left with all the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday nodding attentively as rector gave him his final instructions
 he was to get involved in no arguments; he was to try to make no converts; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard 10
 it was a ridiculous situation and rector knew it for hino frankly partisan openly gregarious would make a poor espionage agent
 if he wanted to know anything he would end up asking about it point-blank but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection 7
 in all of his experience in the mission field rector had never seen a convert quite like hino
 from the moment that hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job any job- his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise hand- he had been ready to become a christian 8
 he had already been studying the bible; he knew the fundamentals and after studying with fletcher for a time he approached rector announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that 6
 rector had never been able to find out much about hino's past 8
 hino talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration in connection with another subject
 putting the pieces of this mosaic together rector had the vague outlines of a biography
 hino was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast in chiba and divided his life between the land and the sea supplementing the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment on a fishing boat
 without exception hino's brothers turned to either one or both of their father's occupations but hino showed a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller
 he had gone into the japanese navy had been trained as an officer had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five quite as a bolt out of the blue he had walked into the mission as if he belonged here and had become a christian
 rector was often curious; often tempted to ask questions but he never did
 if and when hino decided to tell him about his experiences he would do so unasked
 rector had no doubt that hino would come back from the village bursting with information ready to impart it with his customary gusto liberally embellished with his active imagnation
 when the telephone rang on the day after hino went down to the village rector had a hunch it would be hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until his return for there were few telephones in the village and the phone in rector's office rarely rang unless it was important
 he was surprised to find kayabashi's secretary on the other end of the line
 he was even more startled when he heard what kayabashi wanted 9
 the oyabun was entertaining a group of dignitaries the secretary said businessmen from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi wished to show them the mission
 they had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity about it
 i guess it will be all right
 when would the oyabun like to bring his guests up here? 7
    this afternoon the secretary said
 at three o'clock if it will be of convenience to you at that time 8
 i will be expecting them
 he was about to hang up the phone but a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation open
 he had something more to say
 i beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers he said
 unless the oyabun has been working on it he said then checked himself and added: you can tell kayabashi-san that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party to use 7
 the secretary sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in rector's hand
 rector had no idea why kayabashi wanted to visit the mission 8
 for the oyabun to make such a trip was either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all the available information it was probably the latter 5
 kayabashi must feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the village
 at the same time it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity 9
 no kayabashi was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrived 7
 when he had given the call a few moments thought he went into the kitchen to ask mrs yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitors using the formal english china and the silver tea service which had been donated to the mission then he went outside to inspect the grounds
 fujimoto had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn 10
 rector asked him to move it for the time being; he wanted the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless
 a good initial impression would be important now 12
 he went into the print shop where fletcher had just finished cleaning the press
 how many pamphlets do we have in stock? 14
  rector said
 i should say about a hundred thousand fletcher said 16
 why? 15
    i would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon rector said he explained about the visit and the effect he wished to create the picture of a very busy mission
 he did not wish to deceive kayabashi exactly just to display the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner
 fletcher nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange the things rector requested
 rector's next stop was at the schoolroom where mavis was monitoring a test
 he beckoned to her from the door and she slipped quietl y outside
 he told her of the visitors and then of his plans
 how many children do you have present today? 14
  he said
 she looked back toward the schoolroom
 no only fourteen
 the little ito girl had to go home
 she has a pretty bad cold
 i would like them to appear very busy today not busy exactly but joyous exubera nt full of life
 i want to create the impression of a compound full of children 10
 do you think you can manage it? 21
    mavis smiled
 as rector was walking back toward the residential hall johnson came out of the basement and bounded up to him
 the altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen his spirits but he was still a little wary around rector for they had not yet discussed the incident
 i think i've fixed the pump so we won't have to worry about it for a long time he said
 i've adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water gets too low
 he looked out over the expanse of the compound
 it was going to take a lot of activity to fill it 17
 have you ever operated a transit? 20
  he said
 you are about to become a first-class surveyor rector said 13
 when konishi gets back with the jeep i want you to round up two or three japanese boys
 you'll find an old transit in the basement
 the glass is out of it but that won't matter
 it looks pretty efficient and that's the important thing 14
 he went on to explain what he had in mind 13
 he said he could do it
 rector was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential hall
 it was rather a childish game all in all but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much
 he was not sure what effect it would have but that was really beside the point when you got right down to it
 he was not going to lose the mission by default and whatever reason kayabashi had for bringing his little sight-seeing group to the mission he was going to be in for a surprise
 he found elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall and then to take charge of the office while the party was here
 when everything had been done rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly report until three o'clock 8
 at two thirty he sent fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed the approach of kayabashi's party
 then rector attired in his best blue serge suit sat in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a tree smoking a cigarette and waiting 7
 the air was cooler here and the lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass an effect which he found pleasant 6
 she concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one be inconvenient
 the fish took the bait
 he replied that he could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with a stranger but- joy of joys he would be at home at the hour mentioned
 but when she called he had thought better of the matter and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement
 she was told by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed
 claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff daunt her purpose
 she wrote again and now abandoning for the moment the theme of love she asked for help in the matter of her career
 she could act and she could write
 his lordship was concerned in the management of drury lane but if there were no opportunities there would he read and criticize her novel? 7
    at last he consented to meet her and following that brief interview claire wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal:   have you any objection to the following plan? 5
  on thursday evening we may go out of town together by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles
 there we shall be free and unknown; we can return the following morning h   she concluded by asking for a brief interview- to settle with you where- and she threw in a tribute to his gentle manners and the wild originality of your countenance
 she opened his reply with trembling fingers h he agreed! and he would see her that evening
 victory at last!   at their meeting he told her not to bother about where- he would attend to that
 there was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and as claire rose to go he asked her to sing him one song before she left
 she sang him scott's charming ballad rosabelle which was the vogue of the moment
 she had never sung better
 your voice is delightful he approved with a warm smile 7
 tomorrow will be a new experience- i have never before made love to a nightingale h
 there have been cooing doves chattering magpies thieving jackdaws a proud peacock a silly goose and a harpy eagle- whom i was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals 6
 and so they went he choosing of all places an inn near medmenham abbey scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the hellfire club
 he regaled claire with an account of the mock mass performed by the cassocked bloods which he had had at firsthand from old bud dodington one of the leaders of the so-called order
 each wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this it seems was not employed for self-flagellation h
 naked girls danced in the chancel of the abbey the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon filled with veiled depravitie s
 the jaded amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish
 alas all that belonged to the age of devil dashwood and wicked wilkes abbot and beadsman of the order! the casual seduction of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison 5
 they passed close by the turn to bishopsgate 11
 a scant half mile away shelley and mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace the air about them scented with stock and listening to the nightingale who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden
 charming and peaceful- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure? 7
  alone with the fabulous byron! how many women had longed for the privilege that was hers
 how was she to behave claire wondered
 to be passive to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd 8
 she was the pursuer as clearly as was venus in shakespeare's poem 10
 and while her adonis did not suffer from inexperience satiety might well be an equal handicap
 no she would not pretend modesty but neither must she be crudely bold
 mystery- that was the thing
 in the bedroom she would insist on darkness
 with his club foot he might well be grateful
 at the inn which was situated close to a broad weir byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference and addressed as milord
 the place was evidently a familiar haunt and claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown
 the fire in the sitting room was lighted
 what about the bedroom? 13
  byron inquired
 seems to me last time i was here the grate bellowed out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell
 we found some owls had built a nest in the chimney milord but i promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again 7
 so not only had he been here before but it seemed he might well come again
 claire felt suddenly small and cheap heroine of a trivial episode in the voluminous history of don juan
 a cold supper was ordered and a bottle of port
 when napoleon's ship had borne him to elba french wines had started to cross the channel the first shipments in a dozen war-ridden years but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the spanish peninsula still ruled 6
 as they waited for supper they sat by the fire glasses in hand while byron philosophized as much for his own entertainment as hers 6
 sex is overpriced he said
 the great greek tragedies are concerned with man against fate not man against man for the prize of a woman's body
 so don't see yourself as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major importance
 the gods seemed to think sex pretty important she rebutted 7
 mars and venus bacchus and ariadne jupiter and io byron and the nymph of the owl's nest
 that would be minerva i suppose
 wasn't the owl her symbol? 8
    byron laughed
 so you know something of the classics do you? 14
  tell me about minerva how she behaved what she did to please you
 i don't ask you who 'tis you're being unfaithful to husband or lover
 for a moment she thought of answering with the truth but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity who demanded some degree of education in body as well as mind
 very well she said i'll not catechize you
 what matter the others so long as i have my place in history 7
 she was striking the right note
 no man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed with one so favored flattery could hardly seem overdone
 brains and beauty high position in both the social and intellectual worlds athlete fabled lover- if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his
 the light supper over claire went to him and slipping an arm about his shoulder sat on his knee
 he drew her close and hand on cheek turned her face to his 9
 her lips moist and parted spoke his name
 byron!   his hand went to her shoulder and pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown; then to better purpose he took hold of the knot and with dextrous fingers untied it 5
 the bodice beneath was buttoned and withdrawing his lips from hers he set her upright on his knee and started to undo it unhurriedly as if she were a child
 but kindled by his kiss his caressing hand her desire was aflame 9
 she sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom
 lord byron poured himself another glass of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color
 he drank slowly with due appreciation
 it was an excellent vintage
 he rose and went to the bedroom
 pausing in the doorway he said: the form of the human female unlike her mind and her spirit is the most challenging loveliness in all nature
 when claire returned to bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become byron's mistress
 by odd coincidence on the evening of her return shelley chose to read parisina which was the latest of the titled poet's successes 8
 as he declaimed the sonorous measures it was as much as claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings
 although it is not the best of which he is capable said shelley as he closed the book it is still poetry of a high order 9
 if he would only leave the east said mary
 i am tired of sultans and scimitars
 the hero of his next poem is napoleon bonaparte said claire with slightly overdone carelessness
 how do you know that? 18
  demanded mary
 i was told it on good authority claire answered darkly 15
 i mustn't tell i mustn't tell she repeated to herself 8
 i promised him i wouldn't
 9 winter came and with it mary's baby- a boy as she had wished 6
 william he was called in honor of the man who was at once shelley's pensioner and his most bitter detractor 11
 with a pardonable irony shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his daughter:   fanny and mrs godwin will probably be glad to hear that mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement and that her child is well
 at the same time another child- this one of shelley's brain- was given to the world: alastor a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze into the still depths of a fine mind's musings 9
 alastor was published only to be savagely attacked contemptuously ignored
 shelley sent a copy to southey a former friend and another to godwin
 only mary's praise sustained him in his disappointment 8
 not a thought nor a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation
 you have made the labor worth while he said to her smiling 7
 and in the future since i write for a public of one i can save the poor publishers from wasting their money
 a public of one mary echoed reprovingly
 how can you say such a thing? 16
  there will be thousands who will thrill to the loveliness of alastor
 there are some even now
 what about that dear clever mr thynne? 9
  i am sure he is in raptures
 poor mr thynne he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement
 there are other mr thynnes
 not everyone is bewitched by byron's caliphs and harem beauties 7
 mary's supercritical attitude toward byron had nothing to do with his moral disrepute
 she was resentful of his easy success as compared with shelley's failure
 the same month that alastor was published murray sold twenty thousand copies of the siege of corinth a slovenly bit of byronism that even shelley's generosity rebelled at
 the lordly poet was at low-water mark
 the careless writing was in keeping with his mood of savage discontent
 on all sides doors were being slammed in his face
 the previous scandals gaily diverting as they were had only served to increase his popularity
 now under the impact of his wife's disclosures he was brought suddenly to the realization that there was a limit to tolerance however brilliant however far-famed the offender might be 5
 he tried defiance and openly flaunted his devotion to his half sister but he soon saw as did she that this course if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin
 for the moment there was no woman in his life and it was this vacuum that had given claire her opportunity
 but the liaison successfully started in the last days of autumn was now languishing
 byron since the separation from his wife had been living in a smallish house in piccadilly terrace
 he refused to bring claire to it even as an occasional visitor claiming that his every move was watched by spies of the milbankes 7
 beckworth handed the pass to the colonel
 he had thought that the suggestion of taking it himself would tip the colonel in the direction of serving his own order but the slip of paper was folded and absently thrust into the colonel's belt 6
 despite his yearning the colonel would not go down to see the men come through the lines
 he would remain in the tent waiting impatiently occupied by some trivial task
 sir? 15
    -fetch me the copies of everything b and c companies have requisitioned in the last six months
 the last six months sir? 13
    -you heard me
 there's a lot of waste going on here
 i want to take a look
 this is no damned holiday beckworth
 below he could see the bright torches lighting the riverbank 9
 the colonel crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs methodically tearing at his thumbnail
 the bombproof was a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timbers covered with earth
 it stood some fifty paces from the edge of the bank 8
 from the outside it seemed no more than a low drumlin a lump on the dark earth
 a crude ladder ran down to a wooden floor
 two slits enabled observers to watch across the river 9
 the place smelled strongly of rank fertile earth rotting wood and urine
 the plank floor was slimed beneath watson's boots 11
 at least the union officer had been decent enough to provide a candle
 there was no place to sit but watson walked slowly from the ladder to the window slits and back stooping slightly to avoid striking his head on the heavy beams
 in the corner was the soldier with the white flag 10
 he stood stiffly erect clutching the staff his body half hidden by the limp cloth
 watson hardly looked at him
 the man had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant brandishing the flag of truce
 someone had hauled him over the side and he had remained silent while they crossed
 an officer with a squad of men had been waiting on the bank 8
 the men in the boats had started yelling happily at first sight of the officer two of them calling him billy
 when the boat had touched the weaker ones and the two wounded men had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers 7
 watson had presented his pouch and been led to the bombproof 8
 the officer had told him that both lists must be checked 9
 watson had given his name and asked for a safe-conduct pass 7
 the officer surprised said he would have to see
 watson had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists himself later
 he had peered through the darkness at the rampart 13
 the men he would take back across the river stood there but he turned away from them
 he wanted no part of the emotions of the exchange no memory of the joy and gratitude that other men felt
 he had hoped to be alone in the bombproof but the soldier had followed him
 though watson carefully ignored the man he could not deny his presence
 perhaps it would be better to speak to him since silence could not exorcise his form
 watson glanced briefly at him seeing only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner
 we won't be too long
 if my pass is approved i may be a half hour 10
 the soldier answered in a curious muffled voice his lips barely moving
 watson turned away and did not see the man's knees buckle and his body sag
 he had acknowledged the man
 it was easier to think now watson decided
 the stiff figure in the corner no longer blocked his thoughts 7
 he paced slowly stooping staring at the damp slippery floor 8
 he tried to order the words of the three union officers seeking to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy
 his lack of success steadily eroded his interest 10
 he stopped pacing leaned against the dank timbered wall and let his mind drif t
 a feeling of futility an enervation of mind greater than any fatigue he had ever known seeped through him
 what in the name of god was he doing crouched in a timbered pit on the wrong bank of the river? 8
  why had he crossed the dark water to bring back a group of reclaimed soldiers or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole? 8
    he grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion
 he was conscious of a growing sense of absurdity 14
 hillman had written it all out hadn't he? 6
  wasn't the report official enough? 11
  what did he hope to accomplish here? 9
  hillman had ordered him not to leave the far bank 10
 prompted by a guilty urge he had disobeyed the order of a man he respected
 for what? 19
  to tell john something he would find out for himself 8
 the figure in the corner belched loudly a deep liquid eruption 9
 watson snorted and then laughed aloud
 exactly!   the soldier's voice was muffled again stricken with chagrin
 he clutched the staff and his dark eyes blinked apologetically 9
 let's get out of here
 watson ran up the ladder and stood for a second sucking in the cool air that smelled of mud and river weeds
 to his left the two skiffs dented their sharp bows into the soft bank
 the flat-bottomed boat swung slowly to the pull of the current 7
 a soldier held the end of a frayed rope
 three union guards appeared carrying their rifles at ready 6
 watson stared at them curiously
 they were stocky men well fed and clean-shaven with neat uniforms and sturdy boots
 behind them shambled a long column of weak tattered men 10
 the thin gray figures raised a hoarse cawing cry like the call of a bird flock
 they moved toward the skiffs with shocking eagerness elbowing and shoving
 four men were knocked down but did not attempt to rise 6
 they crept down the muddy slope toward the waiting boats 10
 the union soldiers grounded arms and settled into healthy indifferent postures to watch the feeble boarding of the skiffs 6
 the crawling men tried to rise and fell again
 no one moved to them
 watson watched two of them flounder into the shallow water and listened to their voices beg shrilly
 in a confused soaked and stumbling shift of bodies and lifting arms the two men were dragged into the same skiff
 the third crawling man forced himself erect
 he swayed like a drunkard his arms milling in slow circles 7
 he paced forward unsteadily leaning too far back his head tilted oddly
 his steps were short and stiff and with his head thrown back his progress was a supercilious strut
 he appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel that would carry him to freedom
 he stalked into the water and fell heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge his weight nearly swamping the craft 7
 watson looked for the fourth man
 he had reached the three passive guards; he crept in an incertain manner patting the ground before him
 the guards did not look at him
 the figure on the earth halted seemingly bewildered 9
 he sank back on his thin haunches like a weary hound 10
 then he began to crawl again
 watson watched the creeping figure
 he felt a spectator interest
 would the man make it or not? 12
  if only there was a clock for him to crawl against 11
 if he failed to reach the riverbank in five minutes say then the skiffs would pull away and leave him groping in the mud
 say three minutes to make it sporting
 still the guards did not move but stood inert aloof from the slow-scrambling man
 the figure halted and watson gasped
 the man began to creep in the wrong direction deceived by a slight rise in the ground! he turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart
 watson raced for him his boots slamming the soft earth 6
 the guards came to life with astonishing menace 11
 they spun and flung their rifles up
 one man dropped to his knee for better aim
 let me help him for the love of god! the guards lowered their rifles and their rifles and peered at watson with sullen puzzled faces 6
 watson pounded to the crawling man and stopped panting heavily 9
 he reached down and closed his fingers on the man's upper arm 7
 beneath his clutch a flat strip of muscle surged on the bone 8
 watson bent awkwardly and lifted the man to his feet 7
 watson stared into a cadaverous face
 two clotted balls the color of mucus rolled between fiery lids 6
 light sticks of fingers the tips gummy with dark earth patted at watson's throat
 the man's voice was a sweet patient whisper
 henry said that he'd take my arm and get me right there 8
 it don't matter
 is it far? 32
    how far could it be watson thought bleakly how far can a blind man crawl? 7
  another body length or all the rest of his nighted life? 14
    -not far
 not like us fellas
 it raises the voice bein in camp
 can you walk? 15
    -why course i can
 i can walk real good
 watson stumbled down the bank
 the man leaned his frail body against watson's shoulder 13
 he was no heavier than a child
 the man wheezed weakly his fetid breath beating softly against watson's neck
 his sweet whisper came after great effort
 i wish you was henry h
 he promised to take me
 watson supported the man to the edge of the bank and passed the frail figure over the bow of the nearest skiff
 the man swayed on a thwart turning his ruined eyes from side to side
 watson turned away sickened for the first time in many months 10
 he heard the patient voice calling
 henry? 19
  where are you henry? 11
    -make him lie down!   watson snatched a deep breath 8
 he had not meant to shout
 he stood with his back to the skiff
 the men mewed and scratched begging to be taken away 11
 watson spoke bewilderedly to the dark night flecked with pine-knot torches
 goddamn you! what do you do to them? 7
    intelligence jabbed at him accusingly
 he had not felt that during the afternoon
 all his emotions had been inward self-conscious 12
 in war on a night like this it was only the outward emotions that mattered what could be flung out into the darkness to damage others 5
 he was sure of it
 john's type of man allowed this sort of thing to happen 7
 what a fool he had been to think of his brother! so charles was dead
 what did it matter? 14
  his name had been crossed off a list
 already his cool body lay in the ground
 what words had any meaning? 14
  what had he thought of to go to john grovel and beg understanding? 9
  to confess with a canvas chair as a prie-dieu gouging at his heart until a rough and stupid hand bade him rise and go? 6
  men were slaughtered every day tumbled into eternity like so many torn parcels flung down a portable chute
 what made him think john had a right to witness his brother's humiliation? 10
  what right had john to any special consideration? 6
  was john better more deserving? 14
  to hell with john
 let him chafe with impatience to see charles rip open the note with trembling hands and read the formal report in hillman's beautiful schoolmaster's hand
 he believed that brave boys didn't cry
 watson spat on the ground
 he had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother's pain
 now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering
 i would not want to be one of those writers who begin each morning by exclaiming o gogol o chekhov o thackeray and dickens what would you have made of a bomb shelter ornamented with four plaster- of-paris ducks a birdbath and three composition gnomes with long beards and red mobcaps? 6
  as i say i wouldn't want to begin a day like this but i often wonder what the dead would have done
 but the shelter is as much a part of my landscape as the beech and horse-chestnut trees that grow on the ridge
 i can see it from this window where i write
 it was built by the pasterns and stands on the acre of ground that adjoins our property
 it bulks under a veil of thin new grass like some embarrassing fact of physicalness and i think mrs pastern set out the statuary to soften its meaning
 it would have been like her
 she was a pale woman
 sitting on her terrace sitting in her parlor sitting anywhere she ground an axe of self-esteem
 offer her a cup of tea and she would say why these cups look just like a set i gave to the salvation army last year
 show her the new swimming pool and she would say slapping her ankle i suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes 5
 hand her a chair and she would say why it's a nice imitation of those queen anne chairs i inherited from grandmother delancy 6
 these trumps were more touching than they were anything else and seemed to imply that the nights were long her children ungrateful and her marriage bewilderingly threadbare
 twenty years ago she would have been known as a golf widow and the sum of her manner was perhaps one of bereavement 10
 she usually wore weeds and a stranger watching her board a train might have guessed that mr pastern was dead but mr pastern was far from dead
 he was marching up and down the locker room of the grassy brae golf club shouting bomb cuba! bomb berlin! let's throw a little nuclear hardware at them and show them who's boss
 he was brigadier of the club's locker-room light infantry and at one time or another declared war on russia czechoslovakia yugoslavia and china
 it all began on an autumn afternoon- and who after all these centuries can describe the fineness of an autumn day? 9
  one might pretend never to have seen one before or to more purpose that there would never be another like it
 the clear and searching sweep of sun on the lawns was like a climax of the year's lights
 leaves were burning somewhere and the smoke smelled for all its ammoniac acidity of beginnings
 the boundless blue air was stretched over the zenith like the skin of a drum
 leaving her house one late afternoon mrs pastern stopped to admire the october light
 it was the day to canvass for infectious hepatitis 21
 mrs pastern had been given sixteen names a bundle of literature and a printed book of receipts
 it was her work to go among her neighbors and collect their checks 12
 her house stood on a rise of ground and before she got into her car she looked at the houses below
 charity as she knew it was complex and reciprocal and almost every roof she saw signified charity
 mrs balcolm worked for the brain
 mrs ten eyke did mental health
 mrs trenchard worked for the blind
 mrs horowitz was in charge of diseases of the nose and throat 10
 mrs trempler was tuberculosis mrs surcliffe was mothers' march of dimes mrs craven was cancer and mrs gilkson did the kidney 5
 mrs hewlitt led the birthcontrol league mrs ryerson was arthritis and way in the distance could be seen the slate roof of ethel littleton's house a roof that signified gout 7
 mrs pastern undertook the work of going from house to house with the thoughtless resignation of an honest and traditional laborer 5
 it was her destiny; it was her life
 her mother had done it before her and even her old grandmother who had collected money for smallpox and unwed mothers 6
 mrs pastern had telephoned most of her neighbors in advance and most of them were ready for her
 she experienced none of the suspense of some poor stranger selling encyclopedias
 here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass of sherry 8
 the contributions were ahead of what she had got the previous year and while the money of course was not hers it excited her to stuff her kit with big checks
 she stopped at the surcliffes' after dusk and had a scotch-and-soda
 she stayed too late and when she left it was dark and time to go home and cook supper for her husband
 i got a hundred and sixty dollars for the hepatitis fund she said excitedly when he walked in
 i did everybody on my list but the blevins and the flannagans 7
 i want to get my kit in tomorrow morning- would you mind doing them while i cook the dinner? 9
    but i don't know the flannagans charlie pastern said 9
 nobody does but they gave me ten last year
 he was tired he had his business worries and the sight of his wife arranging pork chops in the broiler only seemed like an extension of a boring day
 he was happy enough to take the convertible and race up the hill to the blevins' thinking that they might give him a drink 7
 but the blevins were away; their maid gave him an envelope with a check in it and shut the door
 turning in at the flannagans' driveway he tried to remember if he had ever met them
 the name encouraged him because he always felt that he could handle the irish
 there was a glass pane in the front door and through this he could see into a hallway where a plump woman with red hair was arranging flowers
 infectious hepatitis he shouted heartily
 she took a good look at herself in the mirror before she turned and walking with very small steps started toward the door 7
 oh please come in she said
 the girlish voice was nearly a whisper
 she was not a girl he could see
 her hair was dyed and her bloom was fading and she must have been crowding forty but she seemed to be one of those women who cling to the manners and graces of a pretty child of eight
 your wife just called she said separating one word from another exactly like a child
 and i am not sure that i have any cash- any money that is- but if you will wait just a minute i will write you out a check if i can find my checkbook
 won't you step into the living room where it's cozier? 6
    a fire had just been lighted he saw and things had been set out for drinks and like any stray his response to these comforts was instantaneous
 where was mr flannagan he wondered
 travelling home on a late train? 9
  changing his clothes upstairs? 9
  taking a shower? 16
  at the end of the room there was a desk heaped with papers and she began to riffle these making sighs and and noises of girlish exasperation
 i am terribly sorry to keep you waiting she said but won't you make yourself a little drink while you wait? 8
  everything's on the table
 what train does mr flannagan come out on? 11
  mr flannagan is away she said
 mr flannagan has been away for six weeks h
 i'll have a drink then if you'll have one with me 6
 if you will promise to make it weak
 sit down he said and enjoy your drink and look for your checkbook later
 the only way to find things is to relax
 all in all they had six drinks
 she described herself and her circumstances unhesitatingly 11
 mr flannagan manufactured plastic tongue depressors 8
 he travelled all over the world
 she didn't like to travel
 planes made her feel faint and in tokyo where she had gone that summer she had been given raw fish for breakfast and so she had come straight home
 she and her husband had formerly lived in new york where she had many friends but mr flannagan thought the country would be safer in case of war
 she would rather live in danger than die of loneliness and boredom 9
 she had no children; she had made no friends
 i've seen you though before she said with enormous coyness patting his knee
 i've seen you walking your dogs on sunday and driving by in the convertible h
 the thought of this lonely woman sitting at her window touched him although he was even more touched by her plumpness 7
 sheer plumpness he knew is not a vital part of the body and has no procreative functions
 it serves merely as an excess cushion for the rest of the carcass
 and knowing its humble place in the scale of things why did he at this time of life seem almost ready to sell his soul for plumpness? 6
  the remarks she made about the sufferings of a lonely woman seemed so broad at first that he didn't know what to make of them but after the sixth drink he put his arm around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook there
 i've never done this before she said later when he was arranging himself to leave
 her voice shook with feeling and he thought it lovely 11
 he didn't doubt her truthfulness although he had heard the words a hundred times
 i've never done this before they always said shaking their dresses down over their white shoulders
 i've never done this before they always said waiting for the elevator in the hotel corridor
 i've never done this before they always said pouring another whiskey
 i've never done this before they always said putting on their stockings
 on ships at sea on railroad trains in summer hotels with mountain views they always said i've never done this before
 where have you been? 10
  mrs pastern asked sadly when he came in
 i had a drink with the flannagans
 she told me he was in germany
 charlie ate some supper in the kitchen and went into the tv room to hear the news
 throw a little nuclear hardware at them! show them who's boss! but in bed he had trouble sleeping
 he thought first of his son and daughter away at college 7
 it was the only meaning of the word that he had ever known 24
 then he played nine imaginary holes of golf choosing his handicap his irons his stance his opponents and his weather in detail but the green of the links seemed faded in the light of his business worries
 his money was tied up in a nassau hotel an ohio pottery works and a detergent for window-washing and luck had been running against him 6
 his worries harried him up out of bed and he lighted a cigarette and went to the window
 in the starlight he could see the trees stripped of their leaves
 during the summer he had tried to repair some of his losses at the track and the bare trees reminded him that his pari-mutuel tickets would still be lying like leaves in the gutters near belmont and saratoga
 maple and ash beech and elm one hundred to win on three in the fourth fifty to win on six in the third one hundred to win on two in the eighth
 children walking home from school would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage
 then getting back into bed he thought unashamedly of mrs flannagan planning where they would next meet and what they would do 7
 there are he thought so few true means of forgetfulness in this life that why should he shun the medicine even when the medicine seemed as it did a little crude? 6
  it was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews had not been to see her for ten years not since their last journey eastward to witness their uncle izaak being lowered into the rocky soil; that aside from due notification of certain major events in their lives christmas and easter cards of the traditional sort had been the only thin link she had with them through the widowed years 5
 her thoughts were not discrete
 but there was a look about her mouth as though she were tasting lemons
 she grasped the chair arms and brought her thin body upright like a bird alert for flight
 she turned and walked stiffly into the parlor to the dainty-legged escritoire warped and cracked now from fifty years in an atmosphere of sea spray
 there she extracted two limp vellum sheets and wrote off the letters one to abel one to mark
 once her trembling hand with the pen grasped tight in it was pressed against the paper the words came sharply smoothly as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips 5
 and the stiffly regal look of them she saw grimly lacked the quaver of age which thwarting the efforts of her amazing will ran through her spoken words like a thin ragged string 5
 please come down as soon as you conveniently can the upright letters stalked from the broad-nibbed pen i have an important matter to discuss with you
 to abel: i am afraid there is not much to amuse small children here
 i should be obliged if you could make other arrangements for your daughters
 you may stay as long as you wish of course but if arranging for the care of the girls must take time into account i think a day or two should be enough to finish our business in
 to mark: please give my regards to myra
 she signed the letters quickly stamped them and placed them on the hall table for raphael to mail in town
 then she went back to the wicker chair and resolutely adjusted her eyes to the glare on the water
 my nephews will be coming down she said that evening as angelina brought her dinner into the dining room the whole meal on a vast linen-covered tray
 she looked at the girl speculatively from eyes which had paled with the years; from the early evening lights of them which had first startled izaak to look at her in an uncousinly way they had faded to a near-absence of color which had possibly from her constant looking at the water something of the light of the sea in them
 angelina placed the tray on the table and with a flick of dark wrist drew off the cloth
 she smiled and the teeth gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face
 that will be so nice for you mrs packard she said 6
 her voice was ripe and full and her teeth flashed again in sicilian brilliance before the warm curved lips met and her mouth settled in repose
 um said the old lady and brought her eyes down to the tray 6
 you remember them i suppose? 17
  she glinted suspiciously at the dish before her: blowfish 8
 i hope raphael bought them whole
 angelina stepped back her eyes roaming the tray for omissions 6
 then she looked at the old woman again her eyes calm 10
 yes she said i remember that they came here every summer 6
 i used to play with the older one sometimes when he'd let me 10
 abel? 15
  the name fell with lazy affectionate remembrance from her lips
 for an instant the old aunt felt something indefinable flash through her smile
 she would have said triumph
 then angelina turned and with an easy grace walked toward the kitchen
 jessica packard lifted her head and followed the retreating figure her eyes resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise and fall of the rounded hips
 for a moment she held her face to the empty doorway; then she snorted and groped for her fork
 there's no greater catastrophe in the universe she reflected dourly impaling tender green beans on the silver fork than the dwindling away of a family
 procreation expansion proliferation- these are the laws of living things with the penalty for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments: oblivion
 when the fate of the individual is visited on the group then warm sweet butter dripped from her raised trembling fork and she pushed ah then the true bitterness of existence could be tasted
 and indeed the young garden beans were brackish in her mouth 7
 she was the last living of the older generation 15
 what had once been a widespread family- at one time she knew there were enough packards to populate an entire county- had now narrowed down to the two boys abel and mark
 she swung her eyes up to the blue of the window her jaws gently mashing the bitter beans
 what hope lay in the nephews she asked the intensifying light out there with one married to a barren woman and the other divorced having sired two girl children with none to bear on the packard name? 6
  she ate
 it seemed to her as it seemed each night that the gloom drew itself in and became densest at the table's empty chairs giving her the frequent illusion that she dined with shadows
 here too she talked low quirking her head at one or another of the places most often at izaak's armchair which faced her across the long table
 or it might have been the absent nephews she addressed consciously playing with the notion that this was one of the summers of their early years
 she thought again of her children those two who had died young before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label to their separate malignancies
 the girl her first she barely remembered
 it could have been anyone's infant for it had not survived the bassinet
 but the boy h the boy had been alive yesterday 10
 each successive movement in his growing was recorded on the unreeling film inside her
 he ran on his plump sticks of legs freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes which the camera had caught and held on the paling photographs all carefully placed and glued and labeled resting in the fat plush album in the bottom drawer of the escritoire 4
 in the cruel clearness of her memory the boy remained unchanged quick with the delight of laughter and the pain with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood was still unendurable to her 7
 it was one with the desolate rocks and the alien water on those days when she hated the sea
 the brothers drove down together in mark's small red sports car mark at the wheel
 abel sat and regarded the farm country which spreading out from both sides of the road rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses and long barns and silos nested into the tilled fields 5
 he saw the land with a stranger's eyes all the old familiarness gone
 and it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger impervious complete in itself
 there was stability there too- a color which his life had had once
 that is what childhood is he told himself
 in the stiff neutral lines of the telephone poles he saw the no-nonsense pen strokes of aunt jessica's letter
 what bad grace what incredible selfishness he and mark had shown 7
 the boyhood summers preceding their uncle's funeral might never have been
 they had closed over absolutely with the seali ng of old izaak's grave
 the small car flew on relentlessly
 the old woman stubbornly reigning in the house above the crashing waters took on an ominous reality
 abel moved and adjusted his long legs
 i suppose it has to do with the property mark had said over the telephone when they had discussed their receipt of the letters 8
 not until the words had been spoken did abel suddenly see the old house and the insistent sea and feel his contrition blotted out in one shameful moment of covetousness
 he and mark were the last of the family and there lay the cape ann property which had seemed to have no end stretching from horizon to horizon in those golden days of summer
 now abel turned his head to look at his brother 10
 mark held the wheel loosely but his fingers curved around it in a purposeful way and the deliberate set of his body spoke plainly of the figure he'd make in the years to come
 his sandy hair was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides and abel looked quickly away
 mark easily looked years older than himself settled his world comfortably categorized
 the vacation traffic was becoming heavier as they approached the sea
 she didn't mention bringing myra mark said maneuvering the car into the next lane
 she's probably getting old- crotchety i mean- and we figured uh-uh better not
 they've never met you know
 but myra wouldn't budge without an express invitation 12
 i feel kind of bad about it
 he gave abel a quick glance and moved closer to the wheel hugging it to him and abel caught this briefest of allusions to guilt 8
 i imagine the old girl hasn't missed us much mark added his eyes on the road
 abel ignored the half-expressed bid for confirmation 9
 it was barely possible that his brother was right 12
 he could tell they were approaching the sea 12
 the air took on a special strength now that they'd left the fecund warmth of the farmland behind
 there was the smell of the coast like a primeval memory composed of equal parts salt water clams seaweed and northern ai r 9
 he turned from the flying trees to look ahead and saw with an inward boy's eye again the great fieldstone house which built on one of the many acres of ancestral land bordering the west harbor had been izaak's bride-gift to his cousin-wife as the last century ended 5
 mark's thoughts must have been keeping silent pace beside his own climbing the same crags in dirty white sneakers clambering out on top of the headland and coming upon the sudden glinting water at the same instant
 remember the starbird? 16
  mark asked and abel lifted his eyes from the double lines in the middle of the road the twin white ribbons which the car swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest of the hill and came down
 there was the day uncle izaak had in an unexpected grandiose gesture handed over the pretty sloop to abel for keeps on condition that he never fail to let his brother accompany him whenever the younger boy wished
 the two of them had developed into a remarkable sailing team h all of this happening in a time of their lives when their youth and their brotherhood knitted them together as no other time or circumstance could
 they seemed then to have had a single mind and body a mutuality which had been accepted with the fact of their youth casually 6
 he saw the starbird as she lay her slender mast up and gently turning its point describing constant languid circles against a cumulus sky
 both of them had known the feeling of the small life in her waiting ready for the two of them to run up her sails 9
 the starbird had been long at the bottom of the bay 16
 they came unexpectedly upon the sea
 meeting it without preparation as they did robbed of anticipation a common disappointment seized them
 they were climbing the hill in the night when the headlights abruptly probed solid blackness became two parallel luminous tubes which broadened out into a faint mist of light and ended
 mark stopped the car and switched off the lights and they sat looking at the water which there being no moon out at first could be distinguished from the sky only by an absence of stars 6
 his eyes were old and they never saw well but heated with whisky they'd glare at my noise growing red and raising up his rage 5
 i decided i hated the pedersen kid too dying in our kitchen while i was away where i couldn't watch dying just to entertain hans and making me go up snapping steps and down a drafty hall pa lumped under the covers at the end like dung covered with snow snoring and whistling
 oh he'd not care about the pedersen kid
 he'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky to a slit of a kid and maybe lose one of his hiding places in the bargain
 that would make him mad enough if he was sober 10
 i didn't hurry though it was cold and the pedersen kid was in the kitchen
 he was all shoveled up like i thought he'd be 10
 i pushed at his shoulder calling his name
 i think his name stopped the snoring but he didn't move except to roll a little when i shoved him
 the covers slid down his skinny neck so i saw his head fuzzed like a dandelion gone to seed but his face was turned to the wall- there was the pale shadow of his nose on the plaster- and i thought well you don't look much like a pig-drunk bully now
 i couldn't be sure he was still asleep
 he was a cagey sonofabitch
 i shook him a little harder and made some noise
 i was leaning too far over
 he always slept close to the wall so you had to lean to reach him
 it put you off
 i knew better but i was thinking of the pedersen kid mother-naked in all that dough
 when his arm came up i ducked away but it caught me on the side of the neck watering my eyes and i backed off to cough 8
 pa was on his side looking at me his eyes winking the hand that had hit me a fist in the pillow
 get the hell out of here
 i didn't say anything trying to get my throat clear but i watched him
 he was like a mean horse to come at from the rear 11
 it was better though he'd hit me
 he was bitter when he missed
 get the hell out of here
 he told me to wake you
 a fat hell on big hans
 he found the pedersen kid by the crib
 pa pulled at the covers
 he was tasting his mouth
 hans is rubbing him with snow
 he's got him in the kitchen
 it's the pedersen kid
 nothing to steal from the crib
 he was just lying there
 that's where he was when hans found him
 i ain't hid nothing in the crib
 the pedersen kid
 the kid-   i god damn well understand
 pa had his head up glaring his teeth gnawing at the place where he'd grown a mustache once
 i god damn well understand
 you know i don't want to see pedersen
 why should i? 19
  what did he come for hey? 10
  god dammit get
 find out something
 both you and hans
 he was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow
 he had long black hairs on his wrist
 they curled around the cuff of his nightshirt 11
 big hans made me come
 big hans said-   a fat hell on big hans
 he's an even bigger fool than you are
 fat hey? 16
  i taught him dammit and i'll teach you
 you want me to drop my pot? 9
    he was about to get up so i got out slamming the door 11
 he was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep
 once he went after hans and dumped his pot over the banister 7
 pa'd been shit-sick in that pot
 he didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part of pa's door down before he stopped
 he might not have gone that far if pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house
 that pot put pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it 7
 i always felt the memory was present in both of them stirring in their chests like a laugh or a growl as eager as an animal to be out 5
 i heard pa cursing all the way downstairs
 hans had laid steaming towels over the kid's chest and stomach 7
 he was rubbing snow on the kid's legs and feet 10
 water from the snow and water from the towels had run off the kid to the table where the dough was and the dough was turning pasty sticking to the kid's back and behind
 ain't he going to wake up? 8
    what about your pa? 16
  he was awake when i left
 what'd he say? 13
  did you get the whisky? 9
    he said a fat hell on big hans
 did you ask him about the whisky? 9
  yeah
 well? 15
    he said a fat hell on big hans
 what's he going to do? 9
    go back to sleep most likely
 you'd best get that whisky
 pa's scared to hell of axes
 listen to me jorge i've had enough to your sassing 7
 if i don't get some whisky down him he might die 12
 you want the kid to die? 11
  do you? 15
  well get your pa and get that whisky
 pa don't care about the kid
 he don't care at all and i don't care to get my head busted neither
 he don't care and i don't care to have his shit flung on me 9
 he don't care about anybody
 all he cares about is his whisky and that dry crack in his face 8
 get pig-drunk- that's what he wants
 he don't care about nothing else at all
 that cock
 i'll get the spirits ma said
 i'd wound big hans up tight
 i was ready to jump but when ma said she'd get the whisky it surprised him like it surprised me and he ran down
 ma never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off 6
 not for years
 the first thing every morning when she washed her face she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot cleat and maybe she saw him heaving it again the dirty sock popping out as it flew 5
 it should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for big hans to remember going after the axe while he was still spattered with pa's yellow sick insides
 no you won't big hans said
 yes hans if they're needed ma said
 hans shook his head but neither of us tried to stop her 6
 if we had then one of us would have had to go instead 19
 hans rubbed the kid with more snow h rubbed h rubbed 6
 i'll get more snow i said
 i took the pail and shovel and went out on the porch 7
 i don't know where ma went
 i thought she'd gone upstairs and expected to hear she had 8
 she had surprised hans like she had surprised me when she said she'd go and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have because when i came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three white feathers on its label and hans was holding it angrily by the throat
 oh he was being queer and careful pawing about in the drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm 6
 he was awful angry because he'd thought ma was going to do something big something heroic even especially for her h i know him h i know him h we felt the same sometimes h while ma wasn't thinking about that at all not anything like that
 there was no way of getting even
 it wasn't like getting cheated at the fair
 they were always trying so you got to expect i t
 now hans had given ma something of his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to pa- something valuable; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her there was no easy way of getting it back
 hans cut the foil off finally and unscrewed the cap 6
 he was put out too because there was only one way of understanding what she'd done
 ma had found one of pa's hiding places
 she'd found one and she hadn't said a word while big hans and i had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter every winter since the spring that hans had come and i had looked in the privy and found the first one
 pa had a knack for hiding
 he knew we were looking and he enjoyed it
 she'd found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found saying nothing
 pa was sure to find out
 sometimes he didn't seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't hid one after all or had drunk it up 4
 but he'd find out about this one because we were using it 10
 a fool could see what was going on
 if he found out ma found it- that'd be bad
 he took pride in his hiding
 it was all the pride he had
 i guess fooling hans and me took doing
 but he didn't figure ma for much
 he didn't figure her at all and if he found out h a woman h it'd be bad
 hans poured some in a tumbler
 you going to put more towels on him? 10
  no
 why not? 18
  that's what he needs something warm to his skin don't he? 4
    not where he's froze good
 that's why i only put towels on his chest and belly 4
 he's got to thaw slow
 you ought to know that
 colors on the towels had run
 ma poked her toe in the kid's clothes
 what are we going to do with these? 16
    big hans began pouring whisky in the kid's mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in a second it was dripping from his chin
 here help me prop him up
 i got hold his mouth open
 i didn't want to touch him and i hoped ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't make any move to
 lift don't shove h lift
 i took him by the shoulders
 his mouth fell open
 the skin on his neck was tight
 he was cold all right
 his mouth is open
 he'll choke anyway
 don't hold him like that
 put your arms around him
 he was cold all right
 i put my arm carefully around him
 hans had his fingers in the kid's mouth
 now he'll choke for sure
 just hold him like i told you
 he was cold all right and wet
 i had my arm behind his back
 he was in his mid-fifties at this time long past the establishment of his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again and it was almost a decade since he had sworn off lecturing
 there was never a doubt any more how his structures would be received; it was always the same unqualified success now 7
 he could no longer build anything whether a private residence in his pennsylvania county or a church in brazil without it being obvious that he had done it and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time a quality of authentic uniqueness about them which once established by an artist as his private vision is no longer disputable as to its other values 6
 stowey rummel was internationally famous a crafter of a genuine americana in foreign eyes an original designer whose inventive childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere by his personality
 he had lived for almost thirty years in this same stone farmhouse with the same wife a remarkably childish thing in itself; he rose at half-past six every morning made himself some french coffee had his corn flakes and more coffee smoked four cigarettes while reading last sunday's herald tribune and yesterday's pittsburgh gazette then put on his high-topped farmer's shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop
 this was an enormously long building whose walls were made of rocks some of them brought home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist
 the debris of his other careers was piled everywhere; a pile of wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying on its side on the window sill vertical steel columns wired for support to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting out into the air masonry constructions on the floor from the time he was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through a whole house visible all the way up through wire gratings on each floor
 his files desk drafting board and a high stool formed the only clean island in the chaos
 everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in visible form: his models drawings ten-foot canvases in monochromes from his painting days and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac
 bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for the camden cycly company plant hung on a rope in one corner and over his desk next to several old and dusty hats was a clean pair of roller skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house
 he worked standing with his left hand in his pocket as though he were merely stopping for a moment sketching with the surprised stare of one who was watching another person's hand 7
 sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved
 it all seemed- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows- as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's work
 this air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude toward his things and people often mistook it for boredom in him or a surrender to repetitious routine
 but he was not bored at all; he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite wonderful that the world admired it and he could not imagine why he should alter it 9
 there are after all fortunate souls who hear everything but only know how to listen to what is good for them and stowey was as things go a fortunate man
 he left his home the day after new year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and without a hat
 he would wear this same costume in florida despite his wife cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take some cool clothes with him
 but he was too busy to hear what she was saying 14
 so they parted when she was in an impatient humor 10
 when he was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon feeling in his trouser cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before she came out of the house with an enormous rumanian shawl over her head which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window
 finding the key under his shoe he started the engine and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog and said defrost the refrigerator
 he saw the surprise in her face and laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen
 he kept on laughing until she started laughing with him 8
 he had a deep voice which was full of good food she had cooked and good humor; an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it
 he would settle himself into his seat to laugh
 whenever he laughed it was all he was doing
 and she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog mad as she was at his going away when he really didn't have to mad at their both having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a week to go by 6
 she was forty-nine at this time a lanky woman of breeding with an austere narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort of prayer
 her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair that fell to her shoulders
 there was an air of blindness in her gray eyes the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from money-making and which besides has kept its estate intact
 she was personally sloppy and when she had colds would blow her nose in the same handkerchief all day and keep it soaking wet dangling from her waist and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves
 but just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed brushed and taking breaths of air and even with her broken nails her hands would come to rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy a grace of history so to speak and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions of personal value 5
 she even spoke differently when she was clean and she was clean now for his departure and her voice clear and rather sharp 6
 now drive carefully for god's sake! she called trying to attain a half humorous resentment at his departure
 but he did not notice and was already backing the car down to the road saying toot-toot! to the stump of a tree as he passed it the same stump which had impaled the car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to have removed
 she stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until he had swung the car onto the road
 then when he had it pointed down the hill he stopped to gaze at her through the window
 she had begun to turn back toward the house but his look caught her and she stood still waiting there for what his expression indicated would be a serious word of farewell
 he looked at her out of himself she thought as he did only for an instant at a time the look which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs the look of the gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the tate gallery on a thursday once 4
 now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger and said toot! once more and roared off into the fog his foot evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed the accelerator just as his hand did when he worked
 she walked back to the house and entered feeling herself returning sensing some kind of opportunity in the empty building 6
 there is a death in all partings she knew and promptly put it out of her mind
 she enjoyed great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night but it always seemed to her that being alone especially alone in her house was the realest part of life 4
 now she could let out the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that stowey would let them out one of the doors; she could dust the plants then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the middle on; improvise cha-chas on the harp; and finally the best part of all simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine and the newspapers reading the ads as well as the news registering nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing and desire
 she did this now comfortably aware of the mist running down the windows of the silence outside of the dark afternoon it was getting to be
 she fell asleep leaning on her hand hearing the house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own these two hundred years hearing the birds rustling in their cages and the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm
 every few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things: stowey yes was on his way south and the two boys were away in school and nothing was burning on the stove and lucretia was coming for dinner and bringing three guests of hers
 then she fell asleep again as soddenly as a person with fever and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity was back in her eyes
 she stood up smoothing her hair down straightening her clothes feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping darkness outside and above everything else for the absence of the need to answer to respond to be aware even of stowey coming in or going out and yet now that she was beginning to cook she glimpsed a future without him a future alone like this and the pain made her head writhe and in a moment she found it hard to wait for lucretia to come with her guests
 she went into the living room and turned on three lamps then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn illuminating the driveway 7
 she knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at herself 8
 they were both so young after all so unready for any final parting
 how could it have been thirty years already she wondered? 9
  but yes nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen
 she stood still over the leg of lamb rubbing herbs into it quite suddenly conscious of a nausea in her stomach and a feeling of wrath a sensation of violence that started her shivering 5
 but they all said no your time will come
 enjoy being a bride while you can
 there was no room for company in the tiny weaning house  17
 so when the big house filled up and ran over the sisters- in-law found beds for everyone in their own homes
 and there was still not anything that linda kay could do 18
 so linda kay gave up asking and accepted her reprieve 7
 without saying so she was really grateful; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as bobby joe's wife 6
 she had made curtains for all the windows of her little house and she had kept it spotless and neat shabby as it was and cooked good meals for bobby joe
 she had done all the things she had promised herself she would do but she had not thought of this
 people died she would have said in hospitals or in cars on the highway at night
 bobby joe was gone all day now not coming in for dinner and sometimes not for supper
 when they first married he had been working in the fields all day and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he was working to take him a fresh hot meal
 now there was no work in the fields nor would there be till it rained and she did not know where he went
 not that she complained or had any cause to
 four or five of the cousins from east texas were about his age so naturally they ran around together
 there was no reason for her to ask what they did 12
 thus a new pattern of days began to develop for granny albright did not die
 she lay still on the bed her head hardly denting the pillow; sometimes she opened her eyes and looked around and sometimes she took a little milk or soup
 they stopped expecting her to die the next minute but only in the next day or two
 those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would not go home for she might die any time; but they might as well unpack their suitcases for she might linger on
 so the pattern was established
 when linda kay had put up her breakfast dishes and mopped her linoleum rugs she would go to the big house
 there was not anything she could do there but that was where everyone was or would be
 bobby joe and the boys would come by say how's granny? 7
  and sit on the porch a while
 the older men would be there at noon and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off to the creek or drove down the road towards town
 the women and children stayed at the albrights' 14
 the women keeping their voices low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room sounded like chickens shut up in a coop for the night
 the children had to play away from the house to maintain a proper quietness
 off and on all day someone would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything
 the evaporative cooler had been moved to granny's room and her door was kept shut; so that the rest of the house stayed open though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way 9
 the dust clogged their throats and the heat parched them so that the women were always making ice water
 they had cleaned up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for the crowds who ate and drank there 6
 one afternoon as the women sat clucking softly a new carload of people pulled up at the gat e
 it was a cadillac black grayed with the dust of the road its windows closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled
 they were an old fat couple a thick middle-aged man and a girl about ten or twelve
 there was much embracing much exclaiming
 cousin ada! cousin john! cousin lura! cousin howard! and how is she? 6
  about the same john about the same
 all the women got up and offered their chairs and when they were all seated again the guests made their inquiries and their explanations
 we were on our vacation in canada howard explained in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home
 we came on as soon as we could
 there was the suggestion of ice water and- in spite of the protest we're not really thirsty- linda kay to escape the stuffy air and the smothering soft voices hurried to the kitchen 9
 she filled a big pitcher and set it with glasses on a tray 6
 carrying it to the living room she imagined the picture she made: tall and roundly slim a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath with a graceful swingy walk that she had learned as a twirler with the school band
 almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain at such a time in such a place and she tossed back her long yellow hair smiling shyly as she entered the room
 howard was looking at her
 she felt the look and looked back because she could not help it seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed
 and who is this? 19
  he asked when she passed him a glass
 oh that's linda kay mama albright said fondly 10
 she married our baby boy bobby joe this summer
 let's see cousin ada said
 he's a right smart younger than the rest? 4
    oh yes mama laughed
 he's ten years younger than ernest
 we didn't expect him to come along; thought for the longest he was a tumor
 this joke was not funny to linda kay and she blushed as she always did; then hearing the muffled boom of howard's laughter blushed redder 5
 who is howard anyway? 20
  she asked bobby joe that night
 oh he's a second cousin or something
 he got in the oil business out at odessa and lucked into some money
 how old is he? 19
    gosh i don't know
 he's been married and got this half-grown kid
 if he bothers you don't pay him any mind
 he's just a big windbag
 bobby joe was thinking about something else
 say did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope season on the double x? 7
    he was talking about antelope again when they woke up 11
 listen i never had a chance to kill an antelope 8
 there never was a season before but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth
 did he ever visit here when he was a kid? 13
  linda kay asked
 when he was a kid i wasn't around
 bobby joe took a gun from behind the door and with a quick bye now was gone for the day
 almost immediately howard and his daughter debora drove up in the cadillac
 we're going after ice howard said and thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company
 there was really no reason to refuse and linda kay had never ridden in a cadillac
 driving along the caliche-topped road to town howard talked 6
 finally he said tell me about yourself and linda kay told him because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life 8
 she was such a well-rounded teenager having been a twirler future farmers sweetheart and secretary of future homemakers 6
 in her sophomore year she had started going steady with bobby joe who was a football player future homemakers sweetheart and president of future farmers
 it was easy to see that they were made for each other and they knew what they wanted
 bobby joe would be a senior this year and he planned to graduate 9
 but there was no need for linda kay to go on since all she wanted in life was to make a home for bobby joe and raise his children 8
 you lucky kids he said
 i'd give anything if i could have found a girl like you 4
 then he told linda kay about himself
 of course he couldn't say much really because of debora but linda kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and what a raw deal he had got
 it made her feel different about howard
 she was going to tell bobby joe about how mistaken she had been but he brought one of the cousins home for supper and all they did was talk about antelope
 bobby joe was trying to get linda kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home
 cook a whole antelope? 10
  she exclaimed
 why i couldn't even cook a piece of antelope steak; i never even saw any
 i want to roast the whole thing and have it for the boys 12
 linda kay told him he couldn't do anything like that with his grandma dying and he said well they had to eat didn't they they weren't all dying
 linda kay felt like going off to the bedroom to cry; but they were going up to the big house after supp er and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little
 every night they all went to mama and papa albright's and sat on the open front porch where they could get the breeze
 it was full- of-the-moon and nearly light as day 14
 they all sat around and drank ice water and the men smoked and everybody had a good time
 once in a while they said what a shame it was with granny dying but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other way 6
 that night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting on a moonlight night
 bobby joe and two or three of the other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting and uncle bill farnworth said he would just get up from there and take them right then 6
 after they had left some of the people moved around to find more comfortable places to sit
 there were not many chairs so that some preferred to sit on the edge of the porch resting their feet on the ground and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall
 howard who had been sitting against the wall said he needed more fresh air and took the spot on the edge of the porch where bobby joe had been sitting
 you'll be a darn sight more comfortable there howard ernest said laughing and they all laughed
 linda kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable 8
 bobby joe had been sitting close to her touching her actually and holding her hand from time to time but it seemed at once that howard sat much closer
 perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh so that more of it seemed to come in contact with hers; but she had never been so aware of anyone's flesh before
 still she was not sorry he sat by her but in fact was flattered 8
 he had become the center of the company such stories he had to tell
 he had sold oil stock to bob hope and bing crosby in person; he had helped fight an oil-well fire that raged six days and nights 7
 but tell me doctor where do you plan to conduct the hatching? 8
  alex asked
 that will have to be in the hotel the doctor retorted confirming alex's anticipations
 what i want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel 9
 the doctor paid the bill and they repaired to the hotel room number nine to initiate alex further into these undertakings 6
 the doctor opened the smallest of his cases an unimposing straw bag and exposed the contents for alex's inspection
 inside carefully packed in straw were six eggs but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside; to alex they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs
 there was little enough time to contemplate them however; in an instant the doctor was stalking across the room with an antique ledger in his hands thoroughly eared and big as a table top
 he placed it on alex's lap
 this is my hen ledger he informed him in an absorbed way 11
 it's been going since 1908 when i was a junior in college 7
 that first entry there is the vermont flumenophobe the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties- great big scapulars and hardly any primaries at all
 couldn't take them near a river though or they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before thanksgiving
 the ledger was full of most precise information: date of laying length of incubation period number of chicks reaching the first week second week fifth week weight of hen size of rooster's wattles and so on all scrawled out in a hand that looked more chinese than english the most jagged and sprawling alex had ever seen
 below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed 5
 alex's instruction was rapid for the doctor had to go off to the rue ecole de medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip of wine to sustain him through them all
 but after the doctor's return that night alex could see from the high window in his own room the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen
 a knocking at alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning
 it was the doctor dressed and ready for the expedition to the market and alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste 5
 the doctor stood about waiting for alex to dress with a show of impatience and soon they were moving as quietly as could be through the still-dark hallways past the bedroom of the patronne and so into the street
 the market was not far and once there the doctor's sense of immediacy left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him
 he stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks he gobbled with the turkeys and they at once were all attention he quacked with the ducks and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese
 the dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery
 it was a fine broody hen white with a maternal eye and a striking abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen 8
 the doctor with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope drew alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise have escaped him: the fine color in comb and wattles the length and quality of neck and saddle hackles the firm wide spread of the toes and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets 5
 all search was ended; he had found his fowl
 the purchase was effected and they made their way towards the hotel again the hen with whom some sort of communication had been set up nestling in the doctor's arms
 the clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel entrance; and hopes that the chambermaid and patronne would still be abed began to rise in alex's well exercised breast 6
 the doctor was wearing a long new england greatcoat hardly necessary in the june weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration of hens
 alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who for all his care manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where the hen was cradled
 they advanced in a line across the entrance hall to the stairway and up with gingerly steps towards the first landing
 it was then that they heard the tread of one descending and in some perturbation glancing up saw the patronne coming towards them as they gained the landing
 bonjour messieurs vous etes matinals she greeted them pleasantly 6
 alex explained that they had been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around behind him attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind alex's arm and back 6
 vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors? 6
  their hostess enquired
 alex told her that there was no hurry for their breakfasts trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him
 the doctor he noticed was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well 6
 eyes swerved in the patronne's head alex coughed loudly and the doctor with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him took to the stairs in long-shanked leaps
 comment? 19
  ejaculated the surprised woman looking at alex for an explanation but he parting from her without ceremony only offered a few words about the doctor's provincial american speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands of his work
 with that he hurried up the stairs followed by her suspicious gaze 11
 when alex entered his room the doctor was already preparing a nest in the straw case six eggs ready for the hen's attentions 5
 there was no reference to the incident on the stairs his powers being absorbed by this more immediate business 11
 the hen appeared to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down to the performance of them
 one part of her audience was totally engaged the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some ancient classic the other part the guest of the connoisseur attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does not fully understand 6
 the spectacle progressed towards a denouement which was obviously still remote; the audience attended
 time elapsed but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature
 startled he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view and alex went to the door
 he opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling coughing and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations from the hen who had begun to protest
 it was giselle the fille de chambre come to clean the room and while she stood before him with ears pricked up and regard all curiosity explaining her errand alex could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could to calm the displeased bird 5
 giselle was reluctant but alex succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut again 6
 who was that young feller? 10
  the doctor instantly asked
 that was the fille de chambre the one you thought couldn't get the eggs out
 she looked mighty interested though
 anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room 6
 the doctor's mind was working at a great speed; he rose to put his greatcoat on and addressed alex in a muted voice 6
 have you got our keys handy? 8
    right in my pocket
 now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe
 the hall was empty and alex beckoned; they climbed the stairs which creaked very loudly to their sensitive ears and reached the next floor
 a guest was locking his room; they passed behind him and got to alex's room unnoticed
 the doctor sat down rather wearily caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a poultry-loving man but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more
 at the door alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre to return in ten minutes
 it was evident that a second transfer had to be effected and that it had to take place between the time the fille finished the doctor's room and the time she began alex's
 they waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe; the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine and listened at the door
 a bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows being arranged indicated the fille de chambre's presence inside; they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced another important fact 6
 the doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned the doorknob but to no effect: the lavatory was occupied
 although a look of alarm passed over his face he did not arrest his movements but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged from number nine
 alex suppressed those expressions of relief which offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat; unwarranted they were in any case for as he stood facing the fille de chambre his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower room 4
 the events of the last quarter of an hour mysterious to any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails perhaps mourning her nest but briefly enjoyed
 the doctor's wits had not left him however for all his sixty-eight years and the wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out from the showerhead
 alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual were taking place and entered the doctor's room
 shortly the doctor himself entered his hair somewhat wet from the shower but evidently satisfied with the outcome of their adventures
 without comment he opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside
 next the hen was nested and all seemed well
 the two men sat for some time savoring the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings before they got up and left the hotel the doctor to go to the conference house and alex to go to the main post office
 alex returned to the hotel rather weary and with no new prospects of a role in the late afternoon but found the doctor in an ebullient mood
 at the time alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication with the hen who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully after the occurrences of the morning
 chickens have short memories the doctor remarked that's why they are better company than most people i know and he went on to break some important news to alex
 well he began it seems like some people in paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house do 7
 they've got a big vulture from tanganika at the zoo here with a wife for him too very rare birds both of them the only vulturidae of their species outside africa
 seems like she's willing but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy who took jeannie may behind the barn and then didn't know what to do and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show for their trouble
 going downstairs with the tray winston wished he could have given in to miss ada but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little-girl look
 there were times it wasn't right to make a person happy like the times she came in the kitchen and asked for a peanut butter sandwich 9
 you know we don't keep peanut butter in this house he always told her
 why winston she'd cry i just now saw you eating it out of the jar! but he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure 7
 in the kitchen leona his little young wife was reading the morning paper
 her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool 8
 here winston said gently what's these dishes doing not washed? 8
  the enormous plates which had held mr jack's four fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink
 leave me alone leona said
 can't you see i'm busy? 11
  she looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper 8
 this is moving day winston reminded her and i bet you left things every which way upstairs your clothes all over the floor and the bed not made
 leona! his eye had fastened on her leg; bending he touched her knee
 if i catch you one more time down here without stockings-   she twitched her leg away
 she had an alley cat's manners
 winston stacked miss ada's thin pink dishes in the sink 7
 then he spread out the last list on the counter 7
 to be left behind was printed at the top in miss ada; fine hand
 winston took out a pencil admired the point and wrote slowly and heavily clothes stand
 sighing leona dropped the paper and stood up
 i guess i better get ready to go
 winston watched her fumbling to untie her apron 9
 carefully he undid the bow
 how come your bows is always cockeyed? 11
    she turned and put her arms around his neck 9
 i don't want to leave here winston
 he drew back embarrassed and pleased
 i thought you was sick to death of this big house
 said you wore yourself out cleaning all these empty rooms 6
 at least there is room here she said
 what room is there going to be in an apartment for any child? 7
    i told you what miss ada's doctor said 16
 i don't mean miss ada! what you think i care about that? 4
  i mean our children
 she sounded as though they already existed
 in spite of the hundred things he had on his mind winston went and put his arm around her waist
 we've got plenty of time to think about that
 all the time in the world
 we've only been married four years january
 that's a long time waiting
 how many times have i told you- he began and was almost glad when she cut him off- too many times!- and flounced to the sink where she began noisily to wash her hands
 too many times was the truth of it winston thought 11
 he hardly believed his reason himself any more
 although it had seemed a good reason to begin with: no couple could afford to have children
 how you going to work with a child hanging on you? 9
  he asked leona
 you want to keep this job don't you? 11
  he doubted whether she heard him over the running water 11
 he sat for a while with his hands on his knees watching the bend of her back as she gathered up her things- a comb a bottle of aspirin- to take upstairs and pack
 she made him sad some days and he was never sure why; it was something to do with her back the thinness of it and the quick jerky way she bent
 she was too young that was all; too you ng and thin and straight 8
 winston!   it was mr jack bellowing out in the hall 9
 winston hurried through the swinging door
 i've been bursting my lungs for you mr jack complained 5
 he was standing in front of the mirror tightening his tie 12
 he had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat and his brief case lay on the bench
 i don't know what you think you've been doing about my clothes he said
 this coat looks like a rag heap
 there were a few blades of lint on the shoulder 13
 winston took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work
 he gave mr jack a real going-over; he brushed his shoulders and his back and his collar with long firm strokes
 hey! mr jack cried when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes
 winston apologized and quickly set the hat right 7
 then he stood back to look at mr jack who was pulling on his pigskin gloves
 winston enjoyed seeing him start out; he wore his clothes with style
 when he was going to town nothing was good enough- he had cursed at winston once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace
 at home he wouldn't even wash his hands for supper and he wandered around the yard in a pair of sweaty old corduroys 6
 the velvet smoking jackets pearl-gray wine and blue which miss ada had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet
 good-by winston mr jack said giving a final set to his hat 6
 look out for those movers! winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car; a handsome fine-looking man it made him proud to see 7
 after mr jack drove away winston went on looking out the window 7
 he noticed a speck of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger
 then he looked at his finger at the wrinkled heavy knuckle and the thick nail he used like a knife to pry up slit and open 5
 for the first time he let himself be sad about the move 15
 that house was ten years off his life
 each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward and he knew how to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long glass drops which hung from the chandelier
 he knew the house like a blind man through his fingers and he did not like to think of all the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up
 ten years ago he had come to the house to be interviewed 16
 the tulips and the big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive and he had walked up from the bus almost singing 5
 miss ada had been out back in a straw hat planting flowers 8
 she had talked to him right there with the hot sun in his face which made him sweat and feel ashamed
 winston had been surprised at her for that
 still he had liked the way she had looked in a fresh neat cotton dress- citron yellow if he remembered
 she had had a dignity about her even barefoot and almost too tan 12
 since then the flowers she had planted had spread all over the hill
 already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front gate and the periwinkles were coming on blue by the porch steps 7
 in a week the hyacinths would spike out
 and the dogwood in early may for miss ada's alfresco party; and after that the japanese cherries
 now the yard looked wet and bald the trees bare under their buds but in a while miss ada's flowers would bloom like a marchi ng parade 5
 she had dug a hole for each bulb each tree wore a tag with her writing on it; where would she go for her gardening now? 7
  somehow winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes 6
 sighing he hurried to the living room
 he had a thousand things to see to
 still he couldn't help thinking we're all getting old getting small; the snail is pulling in her horns
 in the living room miss ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in her hand
 she was looking out at the garden
 winston she said get the basket for the breakables 6
 winston h ad the big straw basket ready in the hall 8
 he brought it in and put it down beside her
 miss ada was looking fine; she had on her easter suit blue with lavender binding
 halfway across the house he could have smelled her morning perfume 6
 it hung in all her day clothes sweet and strong; sometimes when he was pressing winston raised her dresses to his face 8
 frowning miss ada studied the list
 the china lemon tree
 winston followed her around the room collecting the small frail objects and wrapping them in tissue paper
 neither of them trusted the movers
 when they came to mr jack's photograph twenty by twelve inches in a curly silver frame miss ada said by rights i ought to leave that seeing he won't take my clotheshorse
 she smiled at winston and he saw the hateful hard glitter in her eyes
 he picked up the photograph and began to wrap it 10
 at least you could leave it for the movers miss ada said 10
 what possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse would be a good idea? 8
    winston folded the tissue paper carefully 10
 he's used it every day; every morning i lay out his clothes on it 3
 and it was his main present! leave that fool picture out she added sharply
 winston laid it in the basket
 mr jack sets store by that
 it was meant to be my present
 but she went on down the list
 winston was relieved; those presents had been on his mind 6
 he had only agreed with miss ada about getting the valet but he had actually suggested the photograph to mr jack
 you know what she likes winston he had said wearily one evening in november when winston was pulling off his overshoes
 tell me what to get her for christmas
 she's been talking about a picture winston had told him 5
 picture! you mean picture of me? 9
  but winston had persuaded him
 on christmas night they had had a disagreement about it 13
 winston had heard because he was setting up the liquor tray i n the next room
 through the door he had seen mr jack walking around waiting for miss ada
 finally she had come down; winston had heard her shaking out the skirt of her new pink silk hostess gown
 how do you like it? 20
  she had asked
 mr jack had said you look about fifteen years old
 is that a compliment? 16
    i don't know
 he had stood at a little distance studying her as though he would walk around next and look at the back of her head 8
 lovie you make me feel naked
 miss ada had giggled and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch and sank down
 you look like that picture i have at the office mr jack had started
 not a line not a wrinkle
 i look like an old man compared and he had picked up his photograph with the red christmas bow still on it
 will you wear pink when you're sixty? 9
    darling i love that photograph
 i'm going to put it on my dresser
 i guess it's children make a woman old
 a man gets old anyhow
 after a minute he went on people must think the curse is on me seeing you fresh as an apple and me old and gray
 i'll give you a medical certificate framed if you like miss ada had said
 all i want is a picture- with a few lines
 make the man put them in if he has to
 after that they had sat for five minutes without saying a word 8
 then miss ada had stood up rustling and rustling and gone upstairs
 was it love? 24
  i had no doubt that it was
 during the rest of the summer my scholarly mania for making plaster casts and spatter prints of catskill flowers and leaves was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions of jessica that my mind served up to me for contemplation and delight 7
 nothing in all the preceding years had had the power to bring me closer to a knowledge of profound sorrow than the breakup of camp the packing away of my camp uniforms the severing of ties with the six or ten people i had grown most to love in the world 5
 in final separation from them in the railroad terminal across the river from new york i would nearly cry
 my parents' welcoming arms would seem woeful inadequate unwanted 7
 but that year was different for just as the city in the form of my street clothes had intruded upon my mountain nights so an essential part of the summer gave promise of continuing into the fall: jessica and i about to be separated not by a mere footbridge or messhall kitchen but by the immense obstacle of residing in cruelly distant boroughs had agreed to correspond
 these letters became the center of my existence 10
 i lived to see an envelope of hers in the morning mail and to lock myself in my room in the afternoon to reread her letter for the tenth time and finally prepare an answer
 my memory has catalogued for easy reference and withdrawal the image of her pink scented stationery and the unsloped almost printed configurations of her neat studious handwriting with which she invited me to recall our summer so many sentences beginning with remember when h; and others concerning camp friends who resided in her suburban neighborhood and news of her commencing again her piano lessons her private school a visit to boston to see her grandparents and an uncle who was a surgeon returned on furlough wounded from the war in europe 4
 in my letters i took on a personality that differed from the self i knew in real life
 then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent dispatching exciting cables and communiques full of dash and wit and glamor quoting from the books i read imitating the grand styles of the authors recommended by a teacher in whose special after-school class i was enrolled
 the letters took their source from a stream of my imagination in which i was transformed into a young man not unlike my bunkmate eliot sands- he of the porch steps anecdotes- who smoked cigarettes performed the tango wore fifty dollar suits and sneaked off into the dark with girls to do unimaginable things with them 6
 like eliot in my fantasies i had a proud bearing and with a skill that was vaguely continental i would lead jessica through an evening of dancing and handsome descriptions of my newest exploits would guide her gently to the night's climax which in my dreams was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death with deep moist kisses burning with love
 the night after reading her letter about her surgeon uncle- it must have been late in september- i had a vision of myself returned in ragged uniform from the front nearly dying my head bandaged and blooded and jessica bending over me the power of her love bringing me back to life
 for many nights afterward the idea of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires would cause me to lie awake in shame tossing with irresolution longing to fall into a deep sleep
 the weeks went by and the longer our separation grew the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies became
 they caused my love for jessica to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless as if my adolescent self knew that only torment would ever bring me the courage to ask to see her again
 as it turned out jessica took matters into her own hands 14
 having received permission to give a camp reunion-halloween party she asked that i come and be her date
 i went and mum and nervous all but made a fool of myself 9
 again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates i was shy with jessie and acted as i had during those early saturday mornings when we all seemed to be playing for effect to be detached and unconcerned with the girls who were properly our dates but about whom later in the privacy of our bunks we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance
 i remember standing in a corner watching jessica act the hostess serving soft drinks to her guests
 she was wearing her dark hair in two thick braids to attain an american girl effect she thought was appropriate to halloween 6
 it made her look sweet and schoolgirlish i was excited to be with her but i did not know how to express it
 yet a moment did come that night when the adventurous letter writer and fantasist seemed to stride off my flashy pages out of my mind and plant himself in reality
 it was late we were playing kissing games and jessica and i were called on to kiss in front of the others
 we blushed and were flustered and it turned out to be the fleetest brush of lips upon cheek
 the kiss outraged our friends but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote exciting premonitions of lust all the mysterious sensations that i had imagined a truly consummated kiss would convey to me
 it was at that party that finally overcoming my timidity inspired by tales only half-understood and overheard among older boys i asked jessie to spend new year's eve with me
 lovingly she accepted and so great was my emotion that all i could think of saying was you're amazing you know? 6
  later we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night 8
 we would write to one another and make a definite plan 15
 among my school and neighborhood friends during the next months i bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date 5
 but though i boasted and gave off a dapper front i was beneath it all frightened
 it would be the first time i had ever been completely alone with a girl i loved
 i had no idea of what subjects one discussed when alone with a girl or how one behaved: should i hold her hand while walking or only when crossing the street? 7
  should i bring along a corsage or se nd one to her? 7
  was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city? 11
  should i accompany her to the door of her home or should i ask to be invited in? 6
  in or out should i kiss her goodnight? 11
  all this was unknown to me and yet i had dared to ask her out for the most important night of the year!   when in one letter jessica informed me that her father did not like the idea of her going out alone on new year's eve i knew for a moment an immense relief; but the letter went on: she had cried she had implored she had been miserable at his refusal and finally he had relented- and now how happy she was how expectant!   her optimism gave me heart
 i forced confidence into myself
 i made inquiries i read a book of etiquette
 in december i wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps of the hotel astor a rendezvous spot that i had learned was the most sophisticated
 we would attend a film and later on i stated we might go to the mayflower coffee shop or child's or toffenetti's for waffles 6
 i set the hour of our meeting for seven
 at five o'clock that night it was already dark and behind my closed door i was dressing as carefully as a groom
 i wore a new double-breasted brown worsted suit with a faint herringbone design and wide lapels like a devil's ears 7
 my camp-made leather wallet bulky with twisted raised stitches around the edges i stuffed with money i had been saving 5
 hatless in an overcoat of rough blue wool i was given a proud farewell by my mother and father and i set out into the strangely still streets of brooklyn
 i felt superior to the neighborhood friends i was leaving behind felt older than my years and was full of compliments for myself as i headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable tantalizing excitement of manhattan
 times square when i ascended to it with my fellow subway travellers dressed as if for a huge wedding in a family of which we were all distant was nearly impassable the sidewalks swarming with celebrants with bundled up sailors and soldiers already hugging their girls and their rationed bottles of whiskey
 heavy-coated severe-looking policemen sat astride noble horses along the curbside to prevent the revellers from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic
 the night was cold but the crowd kept one warm
 the giant electric signs and marquees were lit up for the first time since blackout regulations had been instituted and the atmosphere was alive with the feeling that victory was just around the corner
 cardboard noisemakers substitutes for the unavailable tin models were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands every few yards along broadway and one's ears were continually serenaded by the horns' rasps and bleats
 an old gentlemen next to me held a boy scout bugle to his lips and blasted away at every fourth step and during the interim shouted out v for victory! his neighbors cheered him on
 there was a great sense of camaraderie
 how did one join them? 13
  where were they all walking to? 13
  was i supposed to buy a funny hat and a rattle for jessica? 6
  it was a quarter of seven when the crowd washed me up among the other gallants who had established the astor steps as the beach-head from which to launch their night of merrymaking 6
 i looked over their faces and felt a twinge: they all looked so much more knowing than i
 i looked for jessica to materialize out of the clogging curdling crowd and as the time passed and i waited a fiend came to life beside me and whispered in my ear: how was i planning to greet jessica? 7
  where exactly would we go after the movie? 8
  suppose the lines in front of the movie houses were too long and we couldn't get in? 9
  suppose i hadn't brought along enough money? 8
  i felt for my wallet
 its thick substantial outline calmed me
 but when i saw that it was already ten past seven i began to wonder if something had gone wrong
 suppose her father had changed his mind and had refused to let her leave? 7
  suppose at this very moment her father was calling my house in an effort to cancel the plans? 8
  i grew uneasy
 all about me there was a hectic interplay of meetings taking place like abrupt jerky scenes in old silent movies joyous greetings and beginnings huggings and kissings enthusiastic forays into the festive night
 whole platoons were taking up new positions on the steps arriving and departing while i stayed glued like a signpost to one spot
 at 7:25 two hotel doormen came thumping down the steps carrying a saw-horse to be set up as a barricade in front of the haberdashery store window next to the entranceway and as i watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground their golden fringed epaulets and spic red-visored caps i suddenly saw just over their shoulders jessica gracefully making her way through the crowd
 my heart almost stopped beating
 there were thirty- eight patients on the bus the morning i left for hanover most of them disturbed and hallucinating 10
 an interne a nurse and two attendants were in charge of us 7
 i felt lonely and depressed as i stared out the bus window at chicago's grim dirty west side
 it seemed incredible as i listened to the monotonous drone of voices and smelled the fetid odors coming from the patients that technically i was a ward of the state of illinois going to a hospital for the mentally ill
 i suddenly thought of mary jane brennan the way her pretty eyes could flash with anger her quiet competence the gentleness and sweetness that lay just beneath the surface of her defenses
 we had become good friends during my stay at cook county hospital
 i had told her enough about myself to offset somewhat the damaging stories that had appeared in local newspapers after my little adventure in marshall field + co
 she knew that i lived at a good address on the gold coast that i had once been a medical student and was thinking of returning to the university to finish my medical studies
 she knew also that i was unmarried and without a single known relative
 she wasn't quite sure that i felt enough remorse about my drinking or that i would not return to it once i was out and on my own again 5
 i read those newspaper stories about you she had said 10
 you must have loved that girl very much but you couldn't have meant it when you said that you wanted to kill her
 why do you say that? 15
  i asked
 i was full of booze and well a drunk is apt to do anything he says he'll do
 nonsense! i grew up in an irish neighborhood on chicago's west side
 don't tell me about drunks
 you're not the kind to go violent
 were you in love with that girl? 9
    would it make any difference to you if i were mary jane? 7
    she met my eyes suddenly angry
 i wouldn't have gone into nursing if i didn't care about people
 i'm interested in every patient i've helped take care of 5
 when i think of people like you well i-   you what mary jane? 8
    you are young intelligent have a whole lifetime before you to make something worth while of yourself but you mess it up with whiskey indifference self-destructive attitudes
 i don't blame that girl for breaking her engagement with you 4
 was she pretty? 15
    oh yes i said feeling annoyed she was very pretty 7
 you don't believe that i'm going back to medical school and finish do you? 6
    why should i? 12
  i've worked this ward for three months now
 we keep getting the same ones back again and again 8
 they all mean well have great promises to make when they are about to go home but drinking is their sickness
 you've not seemed like them but maybe you are
 you've treated your stay here like a big joke
 it's not a joke to be sent to a place like this or to hanover 3
 i wanted to go to college to- why didn't you? 19
  i asked
 chicago has some of the best- her eyes flashed angrily 12
 that's what i mean about you anderson she said
 you don't seem to know much about reality
 i'll tell you why i didn't go to college; i'm the oldest of six children
 my father's a policeman and makes less than seven thousand dollars a year
 there was no money for tuition for clothes for all the things you apparently take for granted
 nurses' training here doesn't cost anything 10
 they even pay me six dollars a month
 i think it's a good deal
 i'm going to become a good nurse and i've got two baby brothers that are going to have college if i have to work at my profession until i'm an old maid to gi ve it to them
 do you have a boy friend? 25
  i asked
 that's none of your business she said then changed the subject 5
 what about your father and mother don't you think of them when you're in a place like this? 6
    my father and mother died when i was two years old i said 8
 aunt mary died when i was doing my military service 7
 i have no one but myself to worry about
 something in my voice must have touched her deeply because her anger passed quickly and she turned away to keep me from seeing her face 5
 i don't know what i'd do without my family
 we've always been so close
 tell me more about them
 her eyes became bright as she talked about her father and mother aunts and uncles cousins
 listening i felt cheated and lonely as only an orphan can 7
 when she had finished i said:   your dad sounds like a good father and a good policeman
 i'll bet he wouldn't be pleased if a rumdum like me were to ask his daughter for a date- i mean after i'm out of the hospital a month or so from now
 my father is a sergeant of detectives and has been attached to homicide for five years
 he's a pretty good judge of character anderson
 i don't think he'd mind too much if he were sure you'd decided not to be a rumdum in the future
 what about you? 25
  how would you feel about it if i were to ask you for a date when i get through at hanover? 5
    if i thought you were serious about going back to school that you'd learned something from your experiences here and at hanover- well i might consider such an offer
 what about your h that girl you were going to kill? 9
  it suddenly seemed very important to me that mary jane brennan should know the truth about me- that i was not the confused sick irresponsible person she believed me to be
 there are things about me that i can't tell you now mary jane i said but if you'll go out to dinner with me when i get out of hanover i'd like to tell you the whole story
 i can say this: i'm dead serious about going back to school 11
 as for that other girl let's just say that i never want to see her again
 you will get to come home on long weekends from hanover won't you? 11
  yes i'll get one overnight a month
 we'll go up to the edgewater beach hotel for dinner i said 5
 do you like to dance? 18
  they always have a good orchestra
 i like to dance she said then turned and walked away 8
 there hadn't been anything really personal in her interest in me
 it was just that she felt deeply about every patient on the ward and wanted to believe that they might benefit from their treatment there
 now riding this hospital bus feeling isolated and utterly alone i knew that she was genuine and unique quite unlike any girl i had known before
 it seemed the most important thing in my life at this moment that she should know the real truth about me
 it was a fantastic story
 only two people in the state of illinois knew that i was entering hanover state hospital under an assumed name or why 7
 it was unlikely that any girl as sharp as mary jane brennan would believe it without proof
 but i had the proof all documented in a legal agreement which i would show her the moment i was free to do so
 as the bus turned into the main highway and headed toward hanover i settled back in my seat and closed my eyes thinking over the events of the past two weeks trying to put the pieces in order 8
 i wondered suddenly as i listened to the disconnected jabberings coming from the patient behind me if i had not perhaps imagined it all
 perhaps this was reality and dale nelson the actor was delusion; a figment of carl anderson's imagination
 i had come to chicago from new york early in september with a dramatic production called ask tony
 it was a bad play real grade-a turkey which only a prevalence of angels with grandiose dreams of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal
 no one not even the producer had any real hope of getting it back to broadway
 but because it was a suspense gangster story of the capone era many of us felt that it might catch on for a run in chicago continue as a road company and eventually become a movie
 such optimism was completely unjustified
 the critics literally screamed their indignation 13
 ask tony was doomed from the moment kupcinet leveled on it in his sun-times column
 we opened on friday and closed the following monday 11
 out of the entire cast i alone received good notices for my portrayal of a psychopathic killer
 this let me in for a lot of kidding from the rest of the company two members of which were native chicagoans 11
 we were paid off tuesday morning and given tickets back to new york
 i felt lonely and depressed as i packed my bags at the croydon hotel
 it seemed to me that my life was destined to be one brilliant failure after another
 i had been among the top third in my class at nyu had wanted desperately to go to medical school but i'd run out of money and energy at the same time
 then later i had quit my safe secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play
 it seemed to me that i was not only unlucky but quite stupid as well
 i knew that i'd soon be back working as an orderly at the hospital or as a counterman at union news or schraffts while waiting for another acting job to open
 it suddenly occurred to me that i did not particularly like acting that i was at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what i was going to do with my life
 i closed the last bag and stood all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up then went to the bathroom for a drink of water 5
 when i answered it a voice too dignified and british to be real said is this mr dale nelson the actor? 8
  all right i said
 why don't you bastards lay off for a while? 10
    i beg your pardon sir? 12
    all right
 this is dale nelson h the actor
 i'm calling you mr nelson at the request of mr phillip wycoff 8
 could you possibly have lunch with him today? 7
  his car could pick you up at your hotel at twelve 8
 you'll send the rolls-royce of course? 4
    yes of course mr nelson
 i started to say something else appropriate but the man had hung up
 i finally went downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast were drowning their sorrows over the untimely passing of ask tony
 they all bowed low as i approached them
 all right you bastards i said the great actor is about to buy a drink
 i laid a tenspot on the bar and motioned to the bartender to serve a round
 he had just returned my change when the doorman came in off the street to page me
 i walked over to him
 you mr nelson? 24
  he asked
 mr wycoff's car is waiting for you at the east entrance 9
 i followed him out through the lobby to the street 8
 an ancient rolls-royce as shiningly impressive as the day it came off the ship was parked at the curb
 the elderly chauffeur immaculate in a dark uniform stood stiffly at attention holding open the door of the town car
 i was giving the parked cars the once-over
 the oldsmobile with the license number jyj 114 was in stall number five
 okay i said to the attendant i'll let you know if i close the deal on the office in this building
 i walked with him back to the entrance
 he gave me a ticket on the agency car and parked it 12
 i was back in ten minutes
 forgot to get something out of the car i told him showing him my ticket
 he started to say something as i walked in and then suddenly grinned and said oh yes
 you're the one i was talking to about a monthly rental 7
 that's right i told him
 he consulted the parking ticket then looked at a notation and said you're in the third row back toward the rear
 can you find it all right? 11
  sure i told him
 i went back to the agency car and got out an electric bug one of the newest devices for electronic shadowing
 i always keep a set in the car
 i put in new batteries so as to be certain i'd have plenty of power and on my way out walked over to the regular parking stalls and stood looking at them thoughtfully
 i waited until the parking attendant was busy with a customer then slipped around the back of the car with license number jym 114 attached the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walked out 8
 the attendant waved me on
 one of the hardest chores a detective has is hanging around on a city street trying to make himself inconspicuous keeping an eye on the entrance of an office building and waiting
 for the first fifteen or twenty minutes it's possible to be more or less interested in window displays then in people passing by 8
 after a while however a person's mind gets fed up and that magnifies all of the disagreeable physical symptoms which go with that sort of an assignment
 you want to sit down
 your leg muscles and back muscles feel weary
 you're conscious of the fact that your feet hurt that the city pavements are hard
 i waited a solid two hours before my man came out of the office building
 i wasn't far behind him when he entered the parking lot and hurried over to his car
 the attendant recognized me once more and said what did you do about that office? 8
    i haven't made up my mind yet i said
 i have a couple of them i'm figuring on; one here and one that's out quite a ways where there's usually curb parking 9
 that curb parking is undependable and annoying particularly when it rains he said
 i kept trying to get him to take my money
 i'm in a rush right now
 i know where the car is
 want me to drive it out? 7
  i'll have one of the boys get it he said 10
 it's one of the rules on transients
 regulars drive out their own cars
 make it as snappy as you can will you? 9
  i asked
 oh that's all right he said
 you're going to be a regular
 you'll get in the office building here
 you don't want to lease a place way out in the sticks 7
 you get business where the business is not where it isn't 8
 i grinned at him handed him a couple of dollars and said by the time you get the parking charge figured up there should be a cigar in it for you
 i hurried over to the agency heap jumped in started the motor and was just in time to see the car i wanted to shadow turn to the left 6
 i was held up a bit trying to make a left turn 14
 by the time i'd made it he was gone
 i turned on the electric bug and the signal came in loud and clear
 i made time and picked him up within ten blocks 8
 i stayed half a block behind him letting lots of cars keep in between us listening to the steady beep h beep h beep 7
 after fifteen minutes of traffic driving he turned to the left 8
 i couldn't see him but the electric bugging device gave steady beeps when it was straight ahead short half beeps when the car i was following was to the left and long drawn-out beeps when it turned to the right
 if it ever got behind me the beep turned to a buzz 9
 i turned left too soon and got a signal showing that i was still behind him but he was to the right
 after a while the signal became a buzz and i knew he was behind me
 that meant he'd parked someplace
 i made a big circle until i located the car parked at the curb in front of an apartment house
 i found a parking place half a block away sat in the car and waited
 my quarry was in the apartment house for two hours 8
 then he came out and started driving toward the beach 11
 by this time it was dark
 i could get up close to him where there was traffic but had to drop far behind when there wasn't traffic
 my lights would have been a giveaway if i'd tried to shadow him in the conventional manner
 moreover i'd have lost him if it hadn't been for the electronic shadowing device h
 his signal was coming loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turned to a buzz
 i circled the block and found he was in the parking lot of a high-class restaurant
 i sat where i could watch the exit and realized i was hungry 7
 i sat there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steaks tantalizing my nostrils and occasionally catching the aroma of coffee 7
 my man came out an hour later drove to the beach turned right and after half a mile went to the swim and tan motel
 it was a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front
 i remembered it was the peeping tom place
 i waited until my man was coming out of the office with the key to a cabin before i went in to register
 the card the man i was shadowing had filled out was still on the counter
 i noticed that he was in unit 12 and that he had registered under the name of oscar l palmer and wife giving a san francisco address 10
 he had written out the license number of his car but had transposed the last two figures an old dodge which is still good 6
 ninety-nine times out of a hundred the motel manager doesn't check the license number on the plates against the license number the tenant writes out
 if he does it's still better than an even chance he won't notice the transposition of the numbers and if he should notice it the thing can be passed off as an honest mistake
 i used the alias of robert c richards gave the first three letters and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap but a couple of phony numbers in between
 i could have written anything
 the manager of the motel was a woman who apparently didn't care
 she was complying with the law in regard to registrations but she certainly wasn't checking license numbers or bothering the tenants
 you mean you're all alone mr richards? 13
  that's right
 your wife isn't going to join you- later? 10
    i don't think so
 if you expect her to show up she said you'd better put 'and wife' on there
 it's a formality you know
 any difference in the rate? 11
  i asked
 not to you she said smiling
 it's ten dollars either way
 there are ice cubes in a container at the far end and in another by the office
 there are three soft-drink vending machines and if you should be joined by- anybody- try to keep things quiet if you will 7
 we like to run a nice quiet place
 thank you i told her
 i took another sidelong glance at the other registration card then took the key to unit 13 that she had given me and went down long enough to park the car
 the construction was reasonably solid; not like the cracker- box construction of so many of the motel units that have stucco all over the outside but walls that are thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoining apartment
 i put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side i wanted to case
 with the aid of that i could hear my man moving around heard him cough a couple of times heard the toilet flush heard the sound of water running
 whoever his companion was going to be she was going to join him later
 she knew where to come
 he didn't have to telephone
 i was so hungry my stomach felt all lines of communication had been severed
 it's one thing to go without food when you're occupied with some work or when you're simply postponing a meal but when you're dependent on someone else and know that you can't eat until he's bedded down for the night hunger can be a gnawing torture
 i had noticed a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile 8
 the batteries on the bugging device i had put on the car were still fresh enough to send out good strong signals
 the powerful microphone i could press against the wall between my motel unit and that occupied by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation and i was positively nauseated i was so hungry 5
 i got in the car drove down to the drive-in and ordered a couple of hamburgers with everything included a cup of coffee and the fastest service possible
 the place wasn't particularly busy at that time of night and the girl who was waiting on me who was clothed in the tightest-fitting pair of slacks i had ever seen on a woman and a sweater that showed everything there was- and there was lots of it- wanted to be sociable 5
 you really in a hurry handsome? 15
  she asked
 i'm in a hurry beautiful
 it's early in the evening to be in a hurry
 there's lots of time left
 there may not be any women left i said
 she gave a little pout and said i don't get off work until eleven o'clock
 that's when my evening commences
 i'll be here at ten-fifty-five i said
 that's what they all say
 what's that thing going buzz-buzz-buzz in your car? 7
    i said darn it that's the automatic signal that shows when the ignition key is on
 i didn't turn it off
 i reached over and switched off the electronic bugging device 8
 she went in to get the hamburgers and i switched on the device again and kept the signal from dowling's car coming in steady and clear until i saw her starting back with the hamburgers
 then i shut off the device again
 she wanted to hang around while i was eating 10
 don't you think it's selfish to have dinner before you go to pick her up? 3
    no i said
 it's a kindness to her
 you see she's on a diet
 she'll eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and i'm to have one with her so she won't feel out of place
 diets can be terrible the girl said
 how much overweight is she? 13
  not a bit i said but she's keeping her figure in hand 7
 she looked at me provocatively
 good figures should be kept in hand she said and walked away with an exaggerated wiggle
 i turned on the device again half fearful that i might find silence but the buzzes came in loud and clear
 when i switched on the lights for her to come and get the check i had the exact change plus a dollar tip
 the fat man said all we gotta do is go around the corner 8
 the thin man said that-a-way
 second building on the right
 it says police right on the door
 so even if we was as dumb as you take us for we could still find it
 roberta and dave began to back toward the door
 the thin man waved the gun again
 he said right around the corner
 it says water works but there is a policeman on duty too 9
 a night policeman just like in the states
 you know? 25
    canada doesn't have much of this here juvenile delinquency problem but we keep a night policeman all the same on account of the crazy tourists
 at the door dave paused to feel for the latch
 roberta glanced up at her husband
 he was going to be sensible and not try to do anything rash with that gun pointed at him
 she measured the distance from where they stood to the men and the gun measured the distance from the men to the back room 8
 she decided to risk it
 there was something phony about all this gun waving- something not quite what it seemed in the detailed directions for finding the police
 dave had the latch under his thumb now and he removed his arm from his wife in order to pull the door open
 in a flash she was away to the back paying no attention to three angry shouts from the male throats
 she tore open the back door
 it was dark inside the room but enough light spilled from the restaurant behind her to enable her to make out a round table with a green cloth top
 there was a small sideboard with some empty beer bottles on it and perhaps fifteen wooden chairs
 slowly she turned to face the men again
 rat-face at the counter was on his feet
 the distance between where she stood and where dave waited at the outside door was a hundred miles
 keeping her frightened gaze on the men at the counter she began to feel her way to the door
 she sidled along the booths one step at a time
 as she reached dave and felt his arm go around her felt him pull her to the safety of his person she knew with the certainty of despair that something bad had happened to lauren
 the two men watched as dave closed the door behind them watched them cross the sidewalk to their car
 the fat man removed his apron put on a greasy and wrinkled jacket and zipped it over his paunch
 the thin man moved swiftly to the phone and dialed a number 9
 when he was answered he said albert? 15
  vince
 i'm sending you a couple of customers- yeah- just get them out of my hair and keep them out- i don't give a damn what you tell them- only don't believe a word they say- they're out to make trouble for me and it is up to you to stop them- i don't care how- and one more thing- cate's cafe closed at eleven like always last night and rose and clarence corsi left for quebec yesterday- some shrine or other- i think it was called saint simon's- yeah yesterday 4
 got it? 15
    he turned from the phone and strode to the front of the restaurant
 the white buick hadn't moved away yet
 a line of worry formed a twitch pulled his mouth over to one side 6
 he said grosse? 35
  you ain't kidding me- the kid don't know the name of this town? 8
    i ain't kidding you vince
 how could she? 20
  she musta been walking in her sleep- you seen her yourself in here
 howda i know? 10
  remember how she looked when barney held the door for her? 7
  kinda like a zombie? 9
  she was just waking up when we found her at the garage 11
 stupid fools- ain't got enough brains between the two of you-   grosse muttered his head down one hand playing with the zipper on his jacket
 had enough brains to call ya up so as ya could do sompin about it when the parents- i coulda let her go go- his eyes were lowered so he couldn't have seen the narrow pointed face of his companion suddenly writhe with fury; but he was aware of it just the same 5
 he knew vince steiner was one of those men who had to work up a fury once in a while just to prove how dangerous he could be 7
 with a curse vince seized the thing nearest a glass sugar container with a spouted metal top and threw it against the wall opposite
 the heavy glass didn't break but the top flew off; sugar sprayed with a hiss that was loud in the silence
 not really startled but careful to appear so grosse sucked noisily on his pipe
 why does everything have to happen to me? 8
    grosse quietly got a broom and started to sweep up the sugar 7
 his mouth worked over the profanity the obscenities in his vocabulary
 once he said why'n hell didn't you look in the back seat of the car before you drove off? 8
  don't you and barney ever use your brains? 3
    the fat man didn't answer
 he got one of the menus and brushed the spilled sugar onto it and carried it to a box on the floor behind the counter
 he returned the menu to its place between catchup bottle and paper napkin dispenser
 she don't know nothing about them cars
 she thinks she's in a ordinary garage
 how do you know stupid? 14
  and put cate's gun back
 grosse tucked the gun under the counter
 one word of this gets to guardino-   who's telling guardino? 10
    vince swore again
 you get that kid over to rose's house
 he ran a finger down his cheek tracing the scratch there 7
 why can't i leave her locked up in the tool crib? 11
  the thin man stopped his pacing long enough to glance at the clock
 you and barney get her over to rose's before it gets too light 9
 after guardino's left we'll dump the kid somewhere near the border where she kin get home
 god help you if she knows where she's been
 what am i going to do with her all day? 9
  in the tool crib she can't get away
 what the hell do i care what you do with her all day? 8
  just get her where guardino won't see her and start asking questions
 dammit all vince
 i ain't no baby sitter
 vince shouted finally get her over to rose's and i'll come by and see that she stays put
 grosse rubbed the bridge of his nose where it was swollen 9
 you don't hafta get nasty
 i wish you luck when you try scaring that kid 12
 his voice lost its sullen tones and he chuckled
 what is it? 28
  impatiently
 are you a poor dumb canadian or a smart aleck from the states? 10
    vince lifted his hand as if to strike but his thin lips spread in a smile
 where'd you say you was bor n? 9
    in a chicago slum just like you
 and i ain't going back there on account of one lousy kid 10
 lauren landis rubbed her face against the blanket
 she had cried a little because she was frightened 11
 she could easily understand why the two men had been startled to find a strange girl in the back seat of their car but she couldn't understand their subsequent actions
 was it because she had shown panic? 15
  who could blame her for that? 9
  it was one thing to awaken outside a restaurant where your parents were eating and quite another to awaken in a strange garage and know your parents had gone on home without you
 she was glad the fat man had left
 barney was not really frightening
 she jumped as the little man now appeared at the window and reaching through the opening offered her a bottle of coke 5
 she smiled at him wetly
 although she found she was thirsty she was about to refuse when she saw the bottle was unopened
 he placed a bottle opener on the counter
 so he understood her panic
 she blew her nose on a tissue and opened the coke bottle 9
 it was icy cold and tasted delicious
 she felt a lift in spirit
 when she was finished she pushed it back
 the man was busy doing something to the inside of the door-frame on the driver's side of a car
 he looked in her direction but he didn't answer
 she said barney why is he keeping me here? 11
  still no answer
 he seemed to be looking at a point above the little window 16
 lauren said why can't i call my home? 6
  or borrow some money from someone and go home by bus? 7
  i could send the money right back
 barney finished the cigarette he had been smoking 9
 he dropped it and carefully ground it to nothing with the sole of his heavy shoe
 now he looked at her
 he said i only work here
 lauren said please? 13
  but he was back at work on a car
 she dropped her head on her arms on the counter
 how could he be kind one moment and cruel the next? 8
  did he know something that made him feel sad and sorry for her? 8
  and was he afraid to do anything as definite as releasing her? 7
  her heart was thumping painfully; the unknown was so much worse than- what dangers lay ahead for her? 7
  what awful thing had she to face in the next few hours? 9
  something wet and hot was trickling on her wrists 9
 tears? 15
  with a sturdy act of will she turned her mind away from herself; as long as she could do nothing constructive about the situation she was in she would think about something else 5
 her mother and father for instance
 where were they now? 15
  in her mind she followed the white buick along the road somewhere between here and the niagara river
 her father's attention would be on the road ahead and it wouldn't deviate an inch until he crossed the bridge at the falls and took the river road to lasalle and finally turned in at their own driveway at 387 heather heights
 then he would yawn and stretch and shout all out 8
 this is the end of the line
 and what would her mother be doing right now? 6
  her mother would be fast asleep curled up against that wonderful big safe solid shoulder next to her on the front seat
 lauren landis was in trouble and she was alone
 roberta landis put her hand on her husband's arm as he slid in the driver's seat beside her
 somewhere birds were sweetly calling were answered 10
 her teeth chattered so that she made three attempts at speec h before she became intelligible
 i saw that woman's apron behind the door
 there was a wet spot- she couldn't have been gone long 16
 dave made some sound meant to convey agreement
 he inserted the car key in the lock
 she stammered you heard what he said about police? 8
  why don't we drive around the corner? 11
  the car door crashed shut
 the engine throbbed into life
 dave said i got the message
 walk
 suppose lauren comes looking for us? 10
  i can sit here in the car while you walk around the corner 13
 the big car sprang away from the curb like something alive 10
 he said i'm not going to leave my wife and my car out here in sight of those-   roberta glanced at him and stopped trembling 8
 his jowls were spiked by barbs of graying beard
 his small mean eyes regarded marty steadily unblinkingly 10
 his eyes were threaded by little filaments of red as if tiny veins had burst and flooded blood into them
 as he chewed his gum and exuded wheezing breath marty smelt the reek of bad whiskey
 he had driven the car that passed them on the road outside admassy's place
 this was acey squire proprietor of the juke joint
 marty smiled at squire pleasantly and said there was a cab waiting for me here
 do you know where it might have gone? 16
    squire chewed his gum his jaw moving in a steady rhythm 6
 he looked straight at marty
 marty scanned the faces of the others nearest him looked into their staring eyes
 did anyone see my cab? 14
  he asked keeping his voice casual
 he avoided showing any surprise or annoyance when no one answered him
 i have to get back to jarrodsville he went on
 i see there are some cars here
 i wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back to town? 7
  i'd be happy to pay for the favor of course
 the seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer 8
 and then a startling thing occurred
 it was so utterly unexpected that marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly after it had happened 7
 there was no word spoken no apparent signal given 20
 yet the men all moved at the same instant
 they piled into the waiting cars motors roared the cars sped off 8
 the station wagon and the old plymouth headed east toward jarrodsville
 the ford and the pickup truck sped west toward sanford's run 9
 in seconds all four cars were out of sight
 marty land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously in the sky again
 from a great distance thunder growled and broke the silence 9
 land looked back toward the dilapidated house 10
 he thought he saw a pale face at a window
 perhaps it was dora may
 perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him 7
 there were other farmhouses nearby
 across the road there was one no more than a hundred yards away 8
 there was another on this side a little further down 16
 there were many more between here and jarrodsville 15
 telephone poles lined the road
 they reared tall and mocking
 their wires stretched out into infinity
 not a single strand of wire reached into the silent houses beside the red-clay road
 there was nothing he could do but walk
 and jarrodsville was more than three miles away down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire
 marty faced east and started walking down the left side of the road
 after he had proceeded a few feet he paused and turned up the cuffs of his trousers which were already damp and mud-caked 6
 the viscous mud was ankle-deep and in places great puddles spread across the road and reflected the murky light
 as he approached the first farmhouse thunder sounded behind him again closer now and louder like a steadily advancing drum corps 6
 there were several people on the porch of the farmhouse 16
 there was a very old man and a young woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers
 for just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help 10
 perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town 5
 then he realized the utter futility of the idea 12
 they were staring at him in the same blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared
 even the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious 11
 on his side of the road there were two farm hands well back in a field leaning against a plow
 they too stared at him
 the drums of thunder were right behind him now 8
 a foolish thought came into his head
 he remembered a story he had read as a youth
 it was probably one of kipling's tales of the british army 15
 it concerned an officer who had been disgraced and drummed out 9
 the steady roll of the drums had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of the men he had commanded and each man about-faced and turned his back as the officer approached 6
 marty wished these poor farm people would turn their backs 6
 the fencing by the roadside ended
 now the dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch too broad to leap over unless you were an olympic star
 the day's rain had been added to the stagnant water 11
 he was trapped on the road when he heard the sound of an approaching car
 it was coming toward him
 the car was now in sight
 marty's heart skipped a beat when he recognized it 8
 it was the station wagon that had passed his cab on the road the station wagon that had been parked at the burch farm
 it had headed back toward jarrodsville
 that had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road 7
 now acey and his friends were returning to seek him out 8
 the station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of him beside a fenced field
 then there was another sound
 a second car was coming from the west from the direction of sanford's run
 it was the ford that had been outside burch's farm 17
 marty looked helplessly in both directions
 it was a narrow road barely wide enough for two cars to pass 13
 he could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch
 when the two cars were equidistant from him the station wagon started up again and the ford gathered speed
 they bore down on him
 there was nothing he could do except jump into the ditch 16
 he jumped and sank to his knees in muddy water 8
 as the two cars roared by there was a high-pitched eerie nerve-shattering sound
 marty knew how the union soldiers must have felt at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the ragged gray ranks charged at them screaming the wild banshee howl they called the rebel yell
 for moments he stood in water shivering and gasping for breath
 he had turned his ankle slightly and it pained him 10
 the cars with their load of howling men had disappeared in the distance
 there had been two more cars parked at the farm a plymouth and a pickup truck
 they would be coming for him next bearing down on him from both directions
 and then the station wagon and the ford would seek him out again
 he would be harassed repeatedly and would escape death by inches time after time all the way to jarrodsville
 he still had three miles to go
 back east the more affluent juvenile delinquents who could afford hyped-up autos instead of switch blades as lethal weapons played this same game and called it chicken
 he could not go through the fields
 that way was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence
 he had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the rail fence the section by the farmhouse 5
 at least he could climb up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again
 the admassy place could not be far now
 he would go in there climb through the window and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest
 there was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected
 he did not dare climb back up to the road
 he was deep in water but at least they could not reach him there
 he splashed on mud sucking at his feet with each step until he reached the end of the drainage ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm
 he climbed back to the road and he felt utterly exhausted 9
 he stood panting for a moment
 and then he saw something that he had not seen before and panic gripped him again
 the fence his only refuge when the metal death came roaring at him was made of rails all right but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that would rip his flesh if he pressed against it
 he lurched on down the road despairingly because there was no place else to go
 he lost all sense of dignity
 you could not stand on dignity when you were soaked and muddied and your life was at stake
 probably people were watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse too but he did not bother to look 8
 he broke into a dogtrot breathing heavily streaming with sweat 10
 he had to reach admassy's place
 it was his only sanctuary
 the fences on both sides of the road bristled with the barbed wire
 the fences stretched on endlessly
 and then he heard them
 and now he saw them
 the plymouth was coming at him from the east the pickup truck from the west
 they had timed it better this time
 they would reach him at almost exactly the same instant 12
 if he backed against the fence one of the cars would brush him as it passed and he would be cruelly lacerated by the wire 7
 he stumbled to the middle of the road and simply stood there waiting for them a perfect target
 the cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to the floor boards
 they were coming on at reckless speed for such old vehicle s 10
 he held his arms close to his sides and made himself as small as possible
 when the plymouth neared it veered toward him and seemed about to run him down
 he forced himself to stay frozen there
 if he moved he would be in the path of the other car 16
 he thought the fender of the plymouth brushed his jacket as it went by
 in a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by on the other side
 the weird insane sound of the rebel yell reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills
 he did not leave the middle of the road
 he did not try to run
 he trudged on his aching eyes focused straight ahead 11
 he was nearing the admassy house
 he was going to make it he told himself
 and then he heard a car coming from the east and he felt as if he would break down and weep
 oh no not again he said aloud
 there was a new sound a sound as piercing as the rebel yell yet different
 it was the sound of a siren
 now he saw that the approaching car was painted white and he began to wave his arms frantically
 it was the prowl car from the sheriff's office
 the car drew up alongside him and stopped
 get in charley estes said brusquely
 he staggered into the back seat and lay back fighting for breath 7
 there was someone in front with the sheriff
 it was pete holmes the cabdriver
 pete turned around and said to marty i guess you think i'm a yellow-bellied hound
 but there wasn't no use in me staying there
 i couldn't fight a dozen or so of 'em
 if i'd stayed all that i'd have got was four punctured tires and one busted head
 why didn't you wait at the burch house? 11
  you must've known i'd gone to get the sheriff 9
 i was lucky they let me go i guess
 the sheriff was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space
 when it was finally pointed east he said you should never have come out here alone
 every man in every one of these houses is a night rider 6
 then he turned the telephone over to rourke and went into the bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes 7
 rourke was talking on the phone when he came back
 about an hour eh? 19
  are you positive? 14
  he listened a moment and then said hold it
 he turned his head and said alvarez will definitely be in a back room at the jai alai club on south beach within an hour 6
 want to try and meet him there? 9
    shayne looked at his watch
 that wasn't too far from fifth street and should allow him to make scotty's bar by midnight
 he said with satisfaction that's fine tim
 rourke confirmed the appointment over the phone and hung up 8
 i don't know what you're getting into mike he said unhappily 4
 i hope to christ h
 shayne said briskly grab another drink if you want it 7
 we've got one other call to make before i meet alvarez 7
 where? 15
    it's out in the northeast section
 have you got my car here? 8
    it's parked in front
 rourke hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes
 i'd better keep on driving yours shayne decided because i'll be going on over to the beach
 i can drop you back here to pick mine up
 he went to a closet to get a light jacket and took his hat from beside the door
 timothy rourke gulped down the whiskey hastily and joined him asking who are we going to call on in the northeast section? 6
    a lady
 that is maybe not too much of a lady
 at least i want to find out whether she's home yet or not 19
 he opened the door and followed rourke out
 in rourke's car shayne drove east to biscayne boulevard and north toward felice perrin's address which had been given to him by the peralta governess
 as he drove he filled in timothy rourke briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter to go to the peralta house and on his own surmises
 i want to be in scotty's bar at midnight when marsha makes her phone call there he ended grimly
 i don't know whether that threatening letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not but i want to see who takes the call 4
 this deal at las putas buenas where the two knife-men jumped you said rourke with interest that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought by the luscious mrs peralta doesn't it? 6
    it does shayne grunted sourly still able to taste her mouth on his in the green jungle parking lot
 that story of hers about an unsigned note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony
 if it was designed to put me on the spot it would have to have been written before peralta ever called me in on the case 8
 do you think laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband's knowledge? 7
    i haven't the faintest idea
 i think her husband strongly suspects so and that's why he called me in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates h and almost certainly without telling them why he was doing so 5
 isn't this felice's street? 5
  shayne asked peering ahead at the partially obscured street sign 8
 rourke could see it better out the right-hand side and he said yes
 turn to the left i think for that number you gave me 12
 not more than a block or so
 shayne got in the left-hand lane and cut across the boulevard divider
 there was a small neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet palm-lined street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story mansions now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments
 shayne drove westward from the boulevard slowly letting rourke crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers 6
 a sing le automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side
 shayne noted idly that it carried miami beach license plates as he approached and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they passed indicating that it was occupied
 he turned to see the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as rourke said it's the next house mike 6
 instead of pulling into the curb shayne increased his speed slightly to the corner where he swung left
 he went around the corner and parked turning off his lights and motor
 i told you mike said rourke in an aggrieved voice 13
 it was back there h
 shayne said i know it was tim
 his voice was chilling and cold
 did you see the car parked across the street? 11
  i didn't notice it
 i was watching for numbers h
 it has a beach license tim
 two men in the front seat
 i got a quick look at their faces as we went past 7
 unless i'm crazy as hell they're two of painter's dicks 9
 a couple named harris and geely
 those names mean anything to you? 12
    wait a minute mike
 in painter's office this evening h
 the pair whom petey is officially commending for slapping me around and pulling me in
 what are they doing here? 27
    a stake-out i suppose
 maybe with specific orders to see that i don't make contact with her
 i may be wrong
 i'll slide out and walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on biscayne
 you drive on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there 7
 you're a reporter and you're looking for miss perrin to interview her
 make them show their hands
 if they are beach cops on a stake-out they'll admit it to a reporter
 they've got no official standing on this side of the bay 6
 as soon as you find out if they are geely and harris come on around to the lounge where i'll be waiting
 shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out 6
 timothy rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel 8
 the things you talk me into mike h
 how often do they add up to headlines? 15
  you should complain
 he crossed the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the boulevard and north a block to the open restaurant 9
 he was standing at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when rourke came in six or eight minutes later
 the reporter nodded as he moved up beside him at the bar 9
 shayne told the bartender bourbon and water and rourke told him it's those two all right
 i made them show me their identification before i could be persuaded not to call on felice perrin
 shayne said happily i've got it all worked out tim 6
 take your time with your drink
 in exactly three minutes go in that phone booth behind you and call police headquarters
 be excited and don't identify yourself
 just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell of a fight down the street and they better send a patrol car
 then hang up fast and come walking on down to the perrin address 8
 i'll be waiting for you there
 the bartender brought rourke's drink and shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar
 he said in a low voice i've got a date with a lady mister 8
 will that pay for a pint i can take with me
 you know how it is he added with a conspiratorial wink 12
 candy is dandy but liquor is quicker h and you don't have any candy for sale here anyhow
 the bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill 7
 he turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to shayne 8
 as the detective slid it into his pocket rourke asked sadly what in hell are you going to do mike? 7
    make a couple of punk detectives named geely and harris wish to god they'd stayed out of my way this afternoon
 shayne strode out blithely and rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police
 outside shayne hesitated when he saw that rourke had parked his coupe directly in front of the bar headed south
 he walked over to the right-hand door opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket
 he hoped he wouldn't be forced to use it in taking care of the beach detectives but its weight was comforting at his hip 9
 on this side of the bay miami beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen and shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs
 he went swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two beach detectives in the front seat
 he tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around to the right-hand side
 the big paunchy man named geely was on that side half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door
 shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night 5
 geely grunted and slid partly out and shayne's left arm snaked in around his neck to help him while he set himself solidly on the roadway and swung his right fist to the big gum-chewing jaw before geely could straighten up
 shayne stepped back to let him slump to the ground and then dived over him through the open door into harris who was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster somewhat impeded by the steering wheel
 shayne locked his big hands around harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into the roadway
 he hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt the body go limp
 he dropped him into the street a couple of fe et away from geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side
 they were both breathing heavily out cold and shayne didn't think either of them had recognized him or could describe him
 he got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the top sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men and then tossed the open bottle in on the front seat
 he turned then to look toward the lighted boulevard and saw rourke's tall emaciated figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the street toward the opposite side 6
 shayne strolled across to intercept the reporter in front of the two-story house where felice perrin lived and asked casually get the police okay? 7
  sure
 said they'd have a patrol car here fast
 what happened with you? 15
    why the two damned fools got all excited when they saw the bottle and knocked each other out cold shayne said good-humoredly 7
 they'll have fun explaining that to the miami cops 5
 got no business over here on a stake-out anyway
 they went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling
 a row of mailboxes along the wall had numbers and names on them 8
 shayne found one marked perrin 2- a
 the stairway on the right was dark but there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb at the top and they went up 8
 there were two front rooms both dark behind their transoms and there was no sound or light in the entire house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake
 eight nine steps above him roberts had paused
 mickey paused with him waiting no longer impatient trying now to think it out do a little planning
 he looked down over the banister at the hotel desk with the telephone and pen set
 if i could call in they could check the story while we were on our way
 i wouldn't have to tell them i had roberts-   then he heard it like a muffled thud felt a subtle change in air pressure 7
 he glanced up in time to see roberts hurtling down on him from above literally flying through the air his bloody face twisted 5
 mickey tried to flatten against the banister gripped it with one hand but roberts' full weight struck him at that moment in the groin 6
 he gasped for air and the impact tore his hand from the rail 8
 he tumbled with roberts helpless and in agony over and over down the steps
 by a wrenching effort he managed to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on his back and shoulders rather than his head 5
 he was fuzzy in his mind and for a moment helpless on the lobby floor but he was conscious and free of the weight of roberts' body 8
 when his vision cleared he saw the taller one scrambling upward reaching
 mickey was on his knees when roberts turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand
 he felt his empty pocket and knew that roberts had retrieved the only weapon at hand
 mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack
 he rose stiffly forcing his knees to lock
 the knifelike pain in his groin nearly brought him down again 9
 he made himself back off slowly his eyes wary on roberts who now had no more to lose than he
 the pain dulled as he moved and he steadied inside 10
 after a moment he extended one hand the fingers curled 9
 you want to be that big a fool- i was hoping for this 9
 roberts brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps
 he held the razor well out to one side
 he was invulnerable to attack but he could be handled mickey knew if he could be brought to make the first move
 they were eight feet apart when roberts cleared the last step 11
 mickey waited with slack arms
 any time roberts he said
 or would it be easier if i put my hands in my pockets? 6
    the taunt was lost on roberts
 he advanced slowly directly giving no hint of a feint to either side
 he was just short of arm's reach when he stopped 10
 mickey backed off two steps forcing him to come on again 6
 there was a fixed grin on roberts' face made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood
 mickey backed off again and roberts hesitated then came along 6
 they moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts a macabre dance- two steps back two steps forward two steps back
 mickey felt his shoulders come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door
 this was going to be it now any second and what he had to remember was to keep his eye on the razor no matter what even if roberts should feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand was his exclusive concern
 the kick came sudden and vicious but short
 mickey's guts twisted with the effort but he kept his eye on the weapon
 it moved in a silver arc toward his throat then veered downward 6
 he hunched his left shoulder into it and slashed at roberts' forearm with his own felt the blade slide off his sleeve 7
 before roberts could move inside to cut upward toward his face he slammed his right fist into roberts' belly
 roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly
 ducking mickey tripped and fell to one side landing heavily on the wood floor
 then roberts was on him gasping for breath and for a couple of seconds mickey lost sight of the blade
 he felt it rip at the side of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs
 he got a knee up into roberts' belly used both hands and heaved him clear then scrambled to his feet
 they were in the center of the lobby now
 still clutching the razor roberts came up into a crouch shaking his head
 when he charged mickey was ready
 he hit roberts with his left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly then wobbled in mid-air
 with his right fist and nearly all his weight behind it he smashed at the bloodstained face
 roberts careened backward his back arched fought for balance and failing stumbled against the newel post at the foot of the stairs 7
 the sound of his head striking the solid wood was an ultimate sudden-end sound
 he fell on his side across the lowest step rolled over once then lay still
 mickey found himself leaning against the desk with stiff hands panting for breath
 after a minute he went to roberts looked at one of his eyes and felt for a pulse
 roberts appeared to be dead; if not yet then soon very soon 6
 suddenly it was cold in the lobby
 it seemed to him that a long time had passed before he decided what to do
 actually it was no more than eight or ten minutes and the sum of his reasoning came to this: there's no way to take him in now and keep those other two- wister and the one who hired the two of them- from finding out about roberts and lamming out
 the local law here would hold me till they check clear back home and maybe more than that
 by then they could never catch up with the others 12
 there's no other way; i'll have to do it myself
 he looked at where roberts lay sprawled on the step 10
 mickey was sure now he was dead
 one thing he thought nobody knows about it yet 14
 he climbed the stairs went into roberts' room found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could
 he left a few things
 it didn't have to be perfect
 walking away on impulse he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry
 when he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about the room wiping carefully everything he might have touched 7
 it took him nearly an hour
 he went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat 11
 he left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby 15
 he set roberts' suitcase near the front door went outside and walked back to the garage
 he was mildly surprised to find it was snowing 14
 it snowed softly silently an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky
 he could feel it on his face and in his hair
 he found the key to the jeep got it started and warmed it up for five minutes
 then he backed out and swung around to the front drive 10
 he went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor 9
 he put it in his own pocket for safekeeping
 he took the suitcase out to the jeep and put it in the front seat 9
 then he went back for roberts
 the body was heavier than he had anticipated 10
 he got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the jeep
 he dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out then returned to the porch and closed the front door making sure it was unlocked
 he drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier
 it snowed continuously but quietly evenly
 when he reached the dip in the woods he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible
 the jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground
 he drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine
 he parked facing it and left the headlights on but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase he found the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage
 he went back and got the flashlight returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier 11
 he tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it
 when the dust settled he went back to the jeep and carefully worked roberts' body onto his shoulder
 it wasn't like carrying the suitcase
 the soft snow was deceitful underfoot
 inside the passage he had to work his way over the fallen timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden 6
 by the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight 8
 he stood looking down for a few seconds then backed up two or three paces from the edge
 there was too much weight casually to toss it away 15
 he could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out
 it would be a bad place to die
 it was a bad place for roberts to wind up but roberts had asked for it
 it was too late to worry about that
 he knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel 9
 it was a relief to get rid of the weight
 he was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down
 then he got on his knees and rolled roberts' body toward the edge 10
 it hung momentarily on the point of dropping off 11
 he gave it a strong push heard it slide then tumble dryly into the hole
 he got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit 8
 the body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor
 there was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter
 the external signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow probably by the next day
 it wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact 9
 by spring it would be a skeleton
 he made his way back to the jeep
 he had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket
 he climbed down went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit
 it landed on roberts' sprawled right thigh poised precariously then slid off to the ground
 he went back once more to the jeep and started the short drive to the hotel
 in the garage he checked the jeep for signs of the use he had made of it
 there were stains here and there and he cleaned them off using an oiled rag he found on a nail
 he wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the jeep
 he replaced the flashlight where it had been stowed got into his own car and backed it out of the garage
 there were tire marks where it had been but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny
 liz peabody he thought might spend some time grieving for her lost lover but he doubted that she would launch an investigation 5
 he judged her to be a woman of some pride though not much sense 9
 still she would probably have sense enough n ot to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who apparently had run away 5
 he put in a call to cunningham from his hotel room 10
 the maid answered and he decided nancy must be at work 7
 jeb cautioned him not to be too hopeful and then ignoring his own advice said excitedly but it does sound good
 a woman named lisa who tells nobody anything about herself 9
 that courtyard picture with the same initials 14
 i'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm 4
 i'll call you in a day or so
 on the highway he relaxed and enjoyed the drive over lake pontchartrain and along the coast
 gulf springs was ten miles inland- more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions 7
 he checked into a motel and drove downtown
 the courthouse was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome
 instead of the usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town squares the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green shade of florist's grass
 he figured his best bet was a call on the sheriff 10
 a clerk in the outer office took him in to sheriff carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher office 5
 seated in front of the desk hank said i'm looking for some information with very little to go on sheriff
 he explained the background of the case ending with the tenuous clue which had brought him to gulf springs
 the sheriff's swivel chair tilted back
 so you're looking for a woman who married a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned
 if there was such a person i'm afraid she got away with it 12
 pity we don't know more about him
 i think the best bet is to go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms match with the obituaries a little later
 it'll be a tedious job but if you want to try it the old newspaper files are in the basement here in the county supervisor's office 6
 maybe the society editor would remember a good-looking out- of-town bride
 mrs calhoun has been society editor here for twenty-five years 7
 the editor says that marriages may be made in heaven but weddings are made in mrs calhoun's columns
 she's the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the sunday paper and all that
 once when the editor was just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation mrs calhoun and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out beside his bed
 she'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about background 6
 she'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking down heredity and environment
 she'd also remember if the groom died later
 i wish you good luck but please don't dig up too tough a case for me this close to election
 if you find out anything come on back here and we'll get started on it
 tracking down mrs calhoun was like trying to catch up with paul revere between lexington and concord
 it turned out that she also sold real estate cosmetics and hospital insurance
 the wearying trek stretched into the afternoon- from newspaper plant to insurance office to her house and back to the newspaper where he found her at five o'clock
 she was a large woman with a frizzled gray poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter
 it took a couple of minutes to run through her various businesses and get down to the one he wanted
 last year? 18
  well i do remember one
 married a man named vincent black
 i remember her because she didn't want her picture in the paper 9
 first bride like that i've seen in twenty-five years 8
 what reason did she give? 14
  said she had a breaking-out on her face- some sort of allergy- and none of her old pictures was good enough
 i didn't see her till several days later at the wedding and her face looked like it had never had a blemish on it
 but of course you couldn't see too well through the veil 8
 was her name lisa carmody? 13
  now how in hell would i remember that? 6
  never mind
 i can look it up
 do they still live here? 17
  i think they moved away shortly after they were married 6
 he was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred
 i'm sure it'll be in the files
 we usually run a social note when somebody moves away 10
 he stood up and thanked her
 have they inherited some money or something? 9
  she asked with a reportorial gleam in her eye 10
 he said vaguely well it is a little legal matter but nothing like that
 he hurried across to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving
 sounds like what you're after he said when hank had finished 8
 come on let's hurry down before they lock up for the day 6
 in the basement the sheriff took him to a small dingy office occupied by a tall thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves 9
 mr ferrell h hirey lindsay chairman of the board of supervisors 8
 mr ferrell is a private detective hirey
 wants to look up something in the newspaper files so don't lock him in here
 i'll just leave the door open
 it latches when you close it so stay as long as you like 10
 carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half
 now don't shut this door
 it won't open from inside
 before we built the new jail we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail got too crowded
 hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners 7
 they were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with the cold air from hirey's air conditioner coming through the grille
 he walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelves full of big leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all around the walls
 a metal table and four chairs stood in the center
 they're all here back to 1865 carruthers told him
 it's all right to smoke but make sure your cigarettes are out before you leave
 and of course you know not to take clippings 12
 i'll leave the air conditioner on for you mr ferrell said hirey 4
 don't forget to turn it off and close the door good so it'll latch
 hank thanked them and promised to observe the rules 6
 when they had gone he stood for a minute breathing in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming air conditioner couldn't quite dispel
 in a tour around the stacks he found that the earliest volumes began on the left and progressed clockwise around the room 5
 an old weakness for burrowing in records rose up to tempt him 8
 it was indeed all here- almost a century
 from reconstruction to moon rockets
 but he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to the newer ones
 last year's volume was at the top a couple of inches below the ceiling
 near it was a metal ladder on casters attached to the top shelf 7
 he pulled it over climbed up and lifted out the big volume almost losing his balance from the weight of it
 he staggered over and dropped it on the table
 since mrs calhoun remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring he started to plod through several months
 he tried to turn right to the society page in each one but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract him
 at last he found it in the paper of april 2
 it told him little more than mrs calhoun had remembered stating that it had been a small modest wedding compared to some of the others 6
 there was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom
 mr black's life was an open book so to speak from his birth in jackson mississippi through his basketball-playing days at lsu and his attainment of a ba degree which had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager for peerless business machines 4
 the one line on the bride said she was miss lisa carmody from baton rouge
 no mention of new orleans
 hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for mr black 9
 if mrs black was who he thought she was mr black's peerless selling days might well be over
 now for their exodus from gulf springs
 this time the search took twice as long cutting down on his extra reading for he had to pick through several columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue
 he found it in the edition of may 1 5
 the item said mr and mrs black had moved to jackson his home town- so the lovely lisa had been with him a year ago
 next on his program was a call to the jackson office of peerless business machines to find out if vincent black was still with them- or more specifically still with us
 he glanced at his watch saw it was only seven and decided to indulge his weakness now
 for the next hour he scrambled happily up and down the ladder sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen mckinley's assassination the iroquois theater fire in chicago and the hall-mills trial
 in the middle of the stock market crash he heard a slight noise in the outer office
 he turned around saw nothing and decided it must be a mouse 13
 something else distracted him yet there was no sound only tomblike silence
 then he knew it was not sound but lack of it
 the air conditioner was no longer running
 he jumped up and turned around to see the metal door closing 11
 it clanged shut as he sprang toward it
 he pressed his face against the grille
 who's there? 12
    the light shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond- enough for him to see there was no one there 8
 then he heard the outer door closing
 hey come back he shouted
 he thought it must be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around figuring that hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lo ck hen the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind
 unless he was stone-blind the person who'd just left couldn't have missed seeing hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room
 and even if he'd somehow missed seeing him he wouldn't have gone off and left the light on and door open in the file room 4
 whoever it was had meant to shut him up in here had followed him and waited till the courthouse and square were deserted 6
 but why? 23
  to search his room at the motel? 13
  to come back later and kill him after the stores had closed around the square and everybody had left? 5
  no they could kill him just as easy right now 10
 nobody could hear what was going on in this underground vault 7
 then he heard it and smelled it- the steady hissing the dread familiar pungency of gas escaping
 it must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisors' office
 until now lilac gaylor and lila kingsley had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace and choosing 6
 except for those minutes in her room he had lost touch with her as a reality
 gaylor's obsession and cunningham's chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking of lila and lilac separately or together as a legend
 they kept drifting apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide
 i take a little time to think it over
 it was awkward: very awkward
 there would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over
 and angie would hear about it
 and angie knew- time said angie and he smiled very sweet and slow at mr skyros
 not too much time because i'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away
 and i done favors for you big favor not so long back didn't i and i'm right here to take on where pretty left of f
 i don't want no trouble you don't want no trouble nobody wants trouble mr skyros
 dear heaven no thought mr skyros turning away as another man came in
 he straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand; the genial smile seemed painted on his face
 angie knew- speak of dangerous information! angie knew too much entirely already
 really he had mr skyros at bay h   big favor i done you 6
 acourse there's this deal o' denny's- and jackie's- kinda hangin' fire ain't it maybe you've been kinda worryin' over that 6
 and can't say i blame you said angie thoughtfully
 this deal with the ace o' spades
 anything to do with an ace o' spades bad luck
 ace of spades- a widow that was what they called a widow these low-class crooks remembered mr skyros distractedly
 all about that angie knew too
 when things got a little out of hand they very rapidly got a lot out of hand- it seemed to be a general rule
 all just by chance and in a way tracing back to poor frank all of it because naturally- brothers living together- and angie-   mr skyros did not at all like the look on angelo's regular-featured almost girlishly good-looking face- or indeed anything about angelo 6
 mr skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles; he found money much more interesting; but all the same he thought now uneasily of the way in which angelo earned his living- and paid for his own stuff- and eyed the soft smile and the spaniel-like dark eyes and he felt a little ill
 look my friend he said in my life i learn how is it the proverb says better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure
 i stay in business so long because i'm careful 10
 two weeks a month we talk it over again and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that then we make a little deal isn't it? 4
    that's a long while said angie
 i tell you you want to leave it that way i don't fool around with it
 i go over to castro and get fixed up there
 i can't wait no two weeks
 and mr skyros didn't like angie but what with prettyman and three of his boys inside and not likely to come out- and angie such a valuable salesman prettyman said- all the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys- why did everything have to happen at once? 5
  denny said stupidly why you ain't turning angie down are you mr skyros? 5
  i mean we all figured- i guess anybody'd figure- angie-   angelo gave him an affectionate smile
 mr skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me he said 7
 it's ok denny everything's ok ain't it mr skyros? 3
    oh god the name repeated over and over anybody to hear- not being a fool mr skyros knew why
 but aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held- you could say- the whip hand
 and all because of domokous! if mr skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause-   of course there was another factor
 angie worth his weight in gold right now but these users they sometimes went down fast
 who knew angie might not last long h
 the sweat broke out on mr skyros' forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking- hoping- planning- perhaps-   good god above had not domokous been enough? 6
    he patted angelo's thin shoulder paternally 12
 now you don't want to go talking that way he said 9
 sure sure you're the one take over for pretty soon as i get the supply get started up again isn't it? 5
  you don't need worry angelo
 i tell you i know how it is with you my friend i sympathize and i'll make it a special point- a special favor- get in touch and get some stuff just for you
 i don't know if i can manage it tonight or tomorrow but i'll try my best my friend
 you see you got to remember we all got schedules like any business! my man he won't be around a little while he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the elite
 it's awkward you see that isn't it? 10
    well that's your business mr skyros said angie and his dreamy eyes moved past mr skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass window
 i appreciate it you do that
 we don't none of us want no trouble h
 i'm in a room over the golden club on san pedro you just ask for me there you want see me
 or maybe i call you- tonight? 10
  about nine o'clock i call and see if you got any 9
 a couple decks for me mr skyros- and ten-twelve to sell see i like to have a little ready cash
 oh now i don't know about that much said mr skyros 8
 and you know angelo pretty he always keeps it a strict cash basis like they say-   sure said angie
 fifty a throw that the deal? 11
  sure
 i bring you the cash say fi ve hundred for ten decks 10
 never mind how much i cut it how much i get and he smiled his sleepy smile again
 you go 'n' have a look round for it
 i do my best said mr skyros earnestly just for you my friend 6
 this is awkward for everybody isn't it we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes
 but i do my best for you
 he got out of there in a hurry brushing past another man in the door mopping his brow
 the expedient thing- yes very true one must make do as one could in some situations
 it could all be straightened out later
 not very much later but when things had settled down a little 6
 after this deal with the bouvardier woman went through 13
 an ace of spades h
 he was not a superstitious man but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that indeed
 he rather wished he had never got into the business and still- scarcely to be resisted a nice little profit with not much work involved easy money h katya roslev who would be katharine ross so very soon now rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change 5
 she did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks
 usually she marked the few who did thank you you didn't get that kind much in a place like this: and she played a little game with herself seeing how downright rude she could act to the others before they'd take offense threaten to call the manager 4
 funny how seldom they did: used to it probably
 the kind who came into a cheap store like this! grab snatch i saw that first! and here i'll take this i was before her you wait on me now or i don't bother with it see! this kind of place h   she'd be through here just no time at all- leave this kind of thing 'way behind 4
 off at noon and she'd never come back
 money- a lot of money enough
 she'd be smart about it get him to give it to her in little bills so's nobody would suspect- maybe couldn't get it until monday account of that the banks- but that wasn't really long to wait 6
 not when she'd waited so long already
 no need say anything at all to the old woman 11
 she had it all planned out how she'd do
 she'd say she didn't feel good on sunday couldn't go to church- there'd be a little argument but she could be stubborn- and when the old woman had gone quick pack the things she'd need to take all but the dress she'd wear monday and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight for a dime
 then on monday morning- or it might have to be tuesday- get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer
 she wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after katya had left go do the daily shopping
 no need leave a note with it either- or maybe just something like don't worry about me i'm going away to make a better life 5
 it wasn't as if she wanted much
 she didn't mind working hard not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft- all she wanted was a chance where she wasn't marked as what she was
 to be katharine ross and work in a nicer shop somewhere at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes and learn ladies' manners and all like that and get to know different people than up to now not just the ones like her here with foreign-sounding names the ones went to the same church and- different place different job different people she'd be all different too
 prettier she'd do her hair another way; smarter and wear different kinds of clothes- she'd be katharine ross just what that sounded like
 you've give me the wrong change said the customer sharply 5
 think i can't count? 10
    katya made up the amount in indifferent silence 9
 she was listening to other voices out of the future 10
 some of those vaguely-imagined new different people 16
 oh katharine's awfully nice and pretty too i like katharine- let's ask katharine to go with us she's always lots of fun- katharine- soon very soon now h mendoza didn't wake until nearly nine-thirty
 it was going to be another hot day; already the thermometer stood close to ninety
 alison was still sound asleep; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag and found a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom which tasted peculiarly of face powder
 he left a note propped on the desk asking her to call him sometime today and drove home
 after he'd got out fresh liver for bast he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish
 surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle? 8
  he seemed to remember reading somewhere that abyssinians had large litters and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens
 y que sigue despues? 11
 - what then? 5
  he asked her severely
 a lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens- and damn it you know very well if i have them around long impossible to give them away! and i suppose now that you've finally grown up if a little late you'd go on producing kittens every six months or so 5
 yes well it's a pity to spoil your girlish figure- which all those kittens would do anyway- but i think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so there won't be any more h 6
 i wonder if the carters would take one h
 and it's no good looking at me like that as she wound affectionately around his ankles
 maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up
 happened to be in the hall! happened to hear you quarrel about her! oh well you can't really blame lolotte
 she lost her beau to you
 but she was talking of emile when she saw the black line of the open door; sarah remembered it clearly
 i've got to get busy
 miss celie's taken to her bed with the door locked 8
 she opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you 5
 here- she thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into sarah's hand
 not that there's much use in locking up the smokeho use and the storehouse now
 maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat
 i don't want it sarah said firmly
 well- i'll take it down with me as i go
 maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take off with a racing start
 at the door she turned back her roman nose looking very long now and satiric
 ben and lucien have gone after them
 it's just like that book your northern friend wrote- except there aren't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds
 i don't know mrs stowe h
 what can they do if they find them? 14
    they can't do anything
 it's silly childish running after them like that
 but of course the paterollers won't be of any help not with everything so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around god knows where
 she had swished away she had been gone for a long time probably when sarah suddenly realized that she ought to stop her pour out the coffee so no one would drink it
 but then the so-called coffee was bad enough at best cold it was all but undrinkable- especially that cup!   she was deeply horribly sure that lucien had filled it with opium 5
 she had quarreled with lucien she had resisted his demands for money- and if she died by the provisions of her marriage contract lucien would inherit legally not only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office but later when the war was over her father's entire estate
 she felt cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time 7
 now wait a minute she told herself think about it; lucien is not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee 7
 she had lost a bottle of opium- but that was on the trip from new orleans
 or someone had taken it during her first day at honotassa 9
 yes she had missed it after her talk with emile after dinner just before emile was shot
 rilly or glendora had entered her room while she slept bringing back her washed clothes
 so somebody else could have come in too- then or later while she was out of the room
 it would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor 7
 it was not very reasonable to believe that lucien had procured unprocurable opium and come back to honotassa with a formed plan to murder her
 he didn't even know that she was there
 and he certainly couldn't have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she was not the yielding- yes and credible fool he had every right to expect
 no he had been surprised unpleasantly surprised but surprised 11
 then somebody else? 14
  don't question rev had said don't invite danger 4
 her skin crawled: lolotte had told maude that she was in the hall and the door was open
 sarah had begun to tell lucien of emile she had begun to question and a little draft had crept across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall 6
 so lolotte- or anybody- could have listened and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle of opium 5
 that was not reasonable either
 the opium had disappeared before emile's death and whoever shot him could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen sarah's own doubts and suspicions- and questions
 she began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup
 so suppose somebody only wished to frighten her so she would leave honotassa! that made a certain amount of logic
 added to the argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it had been still hot she might even have drunk some of it she wouldn't have taken enough to kill her for she would have been warned by its taste
 it was merely an attempt to frighten her
 she wouldn't go back to new york as maude suggested; she wouldn't run like a scared cat
 but- well she'd be very careful
 she dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense of normal everyday life
 but before she left her room she dug into her big moire bag took out the envelope holding her marriage contract and the wax seal had been broken
 so somebody else knew what would happen to her father's money if she died
 rev had known all along
 rev didn't need to break the wax seal read the contract and find out
 he could conceivably have wished to make sure; rev loved honotassa it was like a part of his breath and body; rev had stressed the need for money
 rev would never have tried to give her poison!   she thrust the envelope back in the bag; there was no point in locking it up in the armoire now it was like locking the barn after the horse was stolen 7
 and in all likelihood by now there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her marriage contract 10
 there was no point either in telling herself again what a fool she'd been
 she went downstairs and received another curious shock for when glendora flapped into the dining room in her homemade moccasins sarah asked her when she had brought coffee to her room and glendora said she hadn't
 too much work this morning miss sarah- everybody gone like that-   sarah swallowed past another kind of constriction in her throat 8
 well then who brought it? 12
    miss maude
 she come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you 7
 glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice
 not much breakfast this morning
 i don't know what we're going to do miss sarah 5
 we've got to eat sarah said curtly because a chill crawled over her again
 the rice wasn't dosed with opium indeed it had no taste at all not a grain of salt
 she ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway with the rain dripping from the vines
 in the kitchen glendora was despairingly picking chickens 18
 get a basket sarah told her
 we'll go to the storehouse
 glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers and went with her through the drizzle to the storehouse
 sarah found the right key and unlocked the door
 it was a long low room like a root cellar for it was banked up with soil and vines had run rampant over that too
 it was dark but dry and cool
 she doled out what glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried peas eggs cornmeal a little salt
 the shelves looked emptier than when miss celie had shown her the storeroom and since the men from the commissary had called; there were certainly now fewer mouths to feed but there was less to feed them with 6
 she took glendora to the smokehouse unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still a quantity of hams and sides of bacon hanging from the smoke-stained rafters
 they wouldn't go hungry not yet
 and the fields were green and growing
 can't you possibly imagine what life is going to be like here? 8
  maude had said
 she sent glendora back to the house her basket and her apron laden
 she stood for a moment rain dripping from the trees over her head thinking of maude
 maude had the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from sarah's room
 maude had the cool ruthlessness to d o whatever she made up her mind to do
 she couldn't see how her death could affect maude 10
 she couldn't see any reason why maude would attempt to frighten her
 besides there was something hysterical and silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her
 maude was neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubted if she had ever been childish
 yet maude had suggested that sarah return to new york 9
 maude could have shot emile- if she'd had a reason to kill him 5
 there was no use in standing there in the drizzle trying to find a link between emile's murder and opium in a cup of coffee 10
 she started back for the house saw a light in the office opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder
 rev george and lolotte were mending shoes
 a lighted lamp stood on the table that dusky drizzling day 7
 they were all three bent over a shabby riding boot; george had a tack hammer
 lolotte held a patch of leather rev steadied something a tiny brad waiting for george's poised hammer
 george said first thing i do when i get to vicksburg again is get me a yankee-   with boots on lolotte laughed softly 6
 rev looked up and saw her
 lolotte looked up and stiffened
 george didn't look up at all
 there was no way to know no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised at sarah's appearance believing her to be drugged and senseless- and just possibly dead
 rev said come in sarah
 reckon you know the news
 and what news sarah thought as satirically as maude might have said it
 rev's face was suddenly a little fixed and questioning 8
 he turned to george and lolotte
 take your cobbler's shop somewhere else
 i want to talk to sarah
 everything in the office the spreading circle of lamplight the patch of leather in lolotte's hands
 george poised with the tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all denied an attempt at murder
 a rush of panic caught sarah
 i mean i've got to- to see to the kitchen
 glendora-   her words jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the question in rev's face
 now why did i do that? 11
  she thought as warm drizzling rain touched her face 10
 she was no schoolgirl refusing to bear tales 10
 as she reached the kitchen door the answer presented itself; if she told anyone of the opium it must be lucien her husband 8
 it might be indeed it had already proved to be a marriage without love but it was marriage
 so she couldn't choose rev as a confidant; it must be lucien 10
 always provided that lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium she thought as coldly and sharply again as maude might have said it
 she paused at the kitchen door caught her breath told herself firmly that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into the kitchen where glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and maude was cleaning lamp chimneys
 miss sarah i can't cut up no chicken
 miss maude say she won't
 again the homely everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious attempt to frighten her- or to murder her
 the homely everyday details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency
 no matter what had happened or hadn't happened somebody had to see about dinner
 she eyed the chickens with if she had known it something of glendora's dismal look and thought with a certain fury of the time she had spent on latin verbs
 i didn't think there was any reason to
 speak to him again anyway
 try talking to some of the fellows he works with friends anyone 6
 try to find out how happy he is with his wife whether he plays around with women
 you might try looking into his wife too
 she might have been talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been having any trouble
 you think black's the one we're looking for? 10
    yeah
 i think he might be conrad said grimly
 then again he might not
 what a stinking world rourke said
 black is gilborn's best friend
 will you be coming back soon? 10
  i think so
 i'm on my way to see the jacobs woman
 gilborn's secretary? 15
  what for? 20
  you don't think gilborn is the-? 9
    i don't think anything
 i just don't want to go off half-cocked before picking up black that's all
 gilborn says he was in his office all day with her yesterday 7
 i'd like to make sure
 also it's just possible she might know something about mrs gilborn
 aren't you ever going to go home? 6
  it sure as hell doesn't look like it does it? 6
  i'm telling you if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us to they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off
 remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet
 conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench massaging his right leg
 he looked at his watch
 it was ten minutes before eleven
 he wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession from lionel black
 thirty years' experience let him know even at this early stage that black was his man
 but he still wanted to know why
 it was a cold windy day the day after kitti's death but stanley gilborn paid no attention to the blustery october wind
 after leaving conrad gilborn had no destination 10
 he simply walked not noticing where he was not caring 10
 he stopped automatically at the street corners waiting for the traffic lights to change unheeding of other people his coat open and flapping
 as he walked he tried to think
 mainly of what conrad had tried to make him believe 7
 there was nothing coherent about his thinking 21
 it was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind: the same ones different ones in no apparent sequence in no logical succession
 the enormity of what conrad had told him made it impossible for gilborn to accept with any degree of realism the actuality of it 6
 conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only 6
 emotionally they penetrated him not at all
 whoever he was and your wife were intimate
 gilborn remembered conrad's exact words
 they made sense and yet they didn't
 he knew conrad had told him the truth
 yet it wasn't so
 it wasn't so because it couldn't be so
 when kitti was alive- and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm- she had been the center of his life 7
 she was the sun he the closest planet orbiting around her the rest of the world existing and visible yet removed
 for fifty-five years he had lived progressing towards a no-goal eating working breathing without plan without reason
 kitti had come along to justify everything
 she was his goal she was his reason
 he had lived all his life waiting for her
 not once in the time that he had known her had he ever considered the possibility not once not for one one-thousandth of a second of her infidelity
 he could not consider it now
 and so he walked aimless again
 the walk ended inevitably right in front of his hotel building 12
 the doorman began to nod his head automatically then remembered who gilborn was what had happened to him the night before 5
 he looked at gilborn with undisguised curiosity 13
 gilborn passed by him without seeing him
 he crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own thoughts
 in the apartment itself all was still
 the police were no longer there
 there was no evidence that anything was different than it had been 12
 except that kitti wasn't there
 without taking off his coat he sat in the blue chair which still faced the closed bedroom door
 at last sitting there in the familiar surroundings the truth began to sink in
 who? 15
  he felt no anger towards kitti no sense that she had betrayed him
 who? 15
    she was all he had everything he had everything he wanted 10
 someone had taken her away from him
 who? 19
    where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger there is a right-hand one he remembered from his school days
 where there is a victim there is a killer
 who? 15
  whoever he was and your wife were intimate
 he rose from the chair took off his coat
 quickly he went into the bedroom
 the bed still showed signs of where kitti had lain 7
 gilborn stood there for a long time
 he looked at the bed unblinkingly
 the bed was empty now
 kitti would lie in it no more
 he would lie in it no more
 gilborn wondered whether kitti had lain in that same bed with h who? 5
    for thirty minutes stanley gilborn stood there 13
 at the end of the half-hour racking his brains thinking over and over again of kitti her friends her past he left the bedroom 9
 who? 19
    he could think of no answer
 gilborn put on his coat again
 before leaving he took one last lingering look at the apartment 8
 he knew he would never see it again
 in the street walking as quickly as he could stanley gilborn was a lone figure
 on blanche jacobs kitti gilborn's death had a quite different effect
 for blanche kitti's death was a source of guilty but nonetheless soaring happy hope
 in blanche's defense it must be said she was unaware of the newborn hope
 if anyone had asked her she would have described herself only as nervous and worried
 the figures on the worksheet paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter
 she wondered whether stanley would call
 she wanted to be with him to give him the comfort and companionship she knew he needed
 she had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she was out
 and now she was feeling sick both from concern about stanley and hunger
 why hadn't he called? 14
    men she reflected even men like stanley are unpredictable 10
 she tried to think of his unpredictable actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't so many after all
 stanley really was quite predictable
 that was one of the things she liked about stanley 16
 he wasn't like so many other men
 the dentist last night for instance
 dinner and the movies had been fine
 he had taken her upstairs to say good night
 she had invited him in for coffee
 it was in the kitchen as she was watching the kettle waiting for the water to boil that he had grabbed for her
 without warning without giving her a chance to prepare for it 8
 from behind he had put his arms on her shoulders turned her around and pressed her to him so close she couldn't breathe
 later she apologized for the long scratch across his face tried to explain she couldn't help herself that the panic arose in her unwanted
 when he left she knew she would never see him again 9
 she could always predict what stanley was going to do ever since she first met him
 except for that one morning
 the morning he walked in to announce to her blushing that he was married
 she thought she was going to die
 she had assumed before then that one day he would ask her to marry him
 blanche couldn't remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion
 she thought it was sometime during the second week she worked for stanley
 it was nothing that he said or did but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him looking forward to his eventual proposal
 she was thirty-one years old then
 her mother was already considerably concerned over her daughter's future
 but blanche had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed mother's continued carping had been able to resist her urgings to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony
 for blanche it was only a matter of time before stanley would propose
 it was to be expected that stanley would be shy slow in taking such a momentous step
 stanley went along in life she knew convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman
 as a result he never looked for it
 but one day she expected he would somehow discover without her having to tell him that there was such a woman in the world; a woman who was willing to give him love faith and anything else a woman could give a husband
 indeed there was a woman who unasked had already given him love 8
 and then unexpectedly stanley made his announcement 11
 on that first day blanche literally thought she was going to die or at the very least go out of her mind
 it might have been easier for her if kitti walker hadn't been everything that blanche was not
 kitti was thirty years younger than stanley taller than stanley prettier than stanley had any right to hope for much less expect 6
 kitti could have married a score of men
 there was no reason for her to marry someone like stanley gilborn there was no need for her to marry stanley 11
 kitti had come into the office on somebody's recommendation because she needed help in preparing her income tax return
 stanley had filled out the return and because when he was finished it was close to the lunch hour he had politely asked kitti to join him never expecting her to accept
 blanche knew all this because the door to stanley's office was open and without straining too hard she could hear everything that was said
 stanley had gone out saying he would be back in an hour 8
 he hadn't come back for over two
 after that day blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened 10
 there were mornings when stanley came in late afternoons when he left early days when he didn't come in at all
 blanche knew something must be causing stanley's new strange behavior but she never once connected it with kitti walker 6
 then six weeks after the day kitti first came into the office stanley announced he and kitti were married
 somehow blanche managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations
 that night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon in acapulco
 while they were away blanche came into the office every morning running things as she had always run them for stanley going through the week in a dazed stupor getting things done automatically out of habit 6
 for exactly one week she was able to continue in this manner 8
 on the morning of stanley's return however her strength left her
 two hours of watching his serenely happy face listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled figures and blanche had to leave
 she stayed away for ten days
 those ten days were like no others that blanche had known 7
 mostly she stayed in bed
 she didn't tell anyone even her mother what was wrong 6
 she refused to have a doctor insisting there was nothing a doctor could do for her
 right said the fingerprint man
 also if you're going to believe those prints you'll have to look for a killer who's a top-grade piano player
 he demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack
 to make it clearer he shifted to acting out but with no change of manner the killing of rose mallory
 his hands snatched at an imaginary bucket swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap like a ball that's been bounced hard
 in the same way he pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that pressing his hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that
 he was moving like a ballet dancer playing for laughs 10
 if rose mallory's killer acted this way catching up with him was going to be a cinch
 we'd know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear twined in his hair
 perhaps if felix had first come upon us when this boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered woman's apartment we might have had less trouble convincing felix of our seriousness
 this you will remember was still new year's day
 by the time felix turned up it was early afternoon which one would think would be late enough so that by then except for small children and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up it could have been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats 6
 he had retained his hat and his horn and whatever fun might still be going he was ready to join it
 that incidentally might give you some idea of what felix was like
 after all he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning
 the me's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination and the body had been removed for autopsy
 the meat wagon therefore was not out in front of the house any more but the cluster of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs to screen any comings and goings
 there was furthermore the crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops to hold them at a decent distance 9
 just put yourself in felix's place for a moment 8
 you're a taxpayer householder landlord
 you've been away from home for the new year festivities but now the party is over and you come home
 defining sobriety in the limited sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol ingested and not yet eliminated from the system you are sober
 you still have your paper hat and you're wearing it but then it is an extraordinary paper hat and in addition to anything else you may be you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame out in the back yard
 it's not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will mr average citizen
 you have your paper horn clutched in your big craggy fist and for your entrance you have planned a noisy colorful and exuberant greeting to your friends and tenants
 you find your house a focus of public and police attention 12
 can you imagine yourself forgetting under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn? 6
  maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness 9
 you shoulder your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door
 you identify yourself and ask him what's going on 12
 instead of answering you he sticks his head in the door and shouts up the stairs
 got the upstairs guy he bellows
 do i send him up? 12
  then he turns back to you
 go on in he says
 they'll tell you what's cooking
 even then as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable official control could you go on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish horn in your hand? 4
    what i'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for felix's being an odd one
 we'd seen his handiwork out in the back yard and the little his tenants had told us of him did make him sound a little special 6
 we were not however prepared for anything like the apparition that confronted us as felix came up the stairs
 he of course must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him but nonetheless i did find his reaction startling
 if felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn because he'd forgotten about them he now remembered 7
 he came bounding up the stairs and joined the dance 9
 he adjusted the hat lifted the horn to his lips as though it were a flute and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert to cavort with him
 our man stopped dead and glowered at felix
 felix threw his head back and laughed a laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house
 this was a bull of a man
 he was big-chested big-shouldered and heavy-armed 17
 his face was ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laughed he showed his teeth which were big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown
 i don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures
 his hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck 12
 he had only a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short 10
 it was almost as white as his teeth
 for a man of his mass he was curiously short 16
 he wasn't a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure 8
 a man with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms is expected to stand taller than five feet five
 for felix it was a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement 6
 the man was just this side of being a freak
 we waited till he had finished laughing and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him
 he was dressed in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor man's country weekend
 dark gray sports jacket lighter gray slacks pink flannel shirt black silk necktie
 he was freshly shaved and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter
 eventually he subsided
 me he said merrily
 that much latin we remember gibby said dryly
 you always live up to your name always like this always making happy? 7
  i try felix said blithely
 the world is full of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene
 i've never noticed that it improves things any
 bully for you gibby said
 what's the rest of your name? 9
    no rest of it
 felix is all there is
 all there ever was? 18
    the past i leave to historians felix intoned demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy
 you live in the present? 11
    in the present felix proclaimed
 is there any other time in which a man can live? 20
    we gibby announced are not philosophers
 we are assistant district attorneys
 this gentleman is a police officer
 he is a fingerprint specialist
 could your future your immediate future be made to include taking us upstairs giving us a bit of space in which our friend can work and making available to him your finger tips? 5
    the happy one could never have looked happier 11
 this was more than joy
 those lovely whorls he chortled
 come right along
 he was prancing along the hall heading for the next flight of stairs
 we're here because of what happened last night he said 4
 since it is important for the record let's have the full name 16
 grubb felix whispered
 felix grubb? 15
  gibby asked not bothering to whisper
 i can't see what would make it necessary for you to know 7
 nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world
 obligingly gibby lowered his voice
 edmund but not for years
 for years it's been just felix
 first thing i did after my twenty-first birthday was go into court and have it officially changed and this is something i don't tell everybody
 that was almost forty years ago
 having volunteered that he was a man of about sixty he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered the number less credible 5
 this was a broth of a boy our felix and nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice and spirit
 we followed him up the stairs
 the cops would gather up connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting
 you may think we didn't need nancy and jean but you always get what you can when you can and we had no guarantee that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were through with this case
 also if we had excluded the ladies we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stood 7
 the killer if in our present group would certainly be interested in knowing that much and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it was i could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on his situation there might always be some way
 if you can possibly avoid it you don't hand out any extra chances
 felix took us into his studio
 it was that oddly shaped space at the very top of the house where ceiling heights had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles of roof slope
 at each angle of its pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades
 when felix first opened the door on it all these shades were tightly drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night 7
 he quickly fixed that rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens on the others
 he flew about the place making these adjustments and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience 8
 none of his movements was tentative
 there was no process of trial and error
 starting with the room completely blacked out as it was when we came in he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting even so much as a crack of glare
 expecting something more-than-average wacky i was surprised by what we found
 there was no display of either works in progress or of finished work
 here and there on work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped over it
 these shapes might have been mad but there was no telling 9
 they were all completely shrouded
 the equipment was solid and heavy and in good condition 7
 everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman's comfort convenience and efficiency
 there were tools about but they were neatly kept
 there was no confusion and no litter
 supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins 6
 andy did not see the newspapers the next day
 someone on his staff- he suspected it was ed thornburg- intercepted them and for this andy was grateful
 he finally fell asleep around six in the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule a crutch he rarely used and didn't awaken until early afternoon
 memory flooded him the instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach
 outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day
 presumably the same sun was shining upon little drew also and those who had kidnapped him
 but where? 29
  it was still a very big world despite all the modern cant to the contrary
 hub was sitting in a chair that blocked the hall door 8
 he was dozing perhaps the only sleep he'd gotten 10
 he snapped to alertness at andy's entrance
 lot of people waiting to see you thoug h
 questions about the show tonight
 hub picked up the telephone
 shall i let them know you're awake? 10
    i suppose
 how's lissa do you know? 11
    hub considered
 she's got plenty of guts mr paxton
 you want me to call her? 11
  she expecting me to? 11
  hub shook his head so andy told him not to bother 6
 the only reason for contacting lissa was to comfort or to be comforted
 he could not manage the former or expect the latter; they had nothing to give to each other
 the omission might look peculiar to outsiders but andy could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake of appearances
 he had little time to himself anyway
 as the afternoon sped toward evening the suite saw a steady procession of paxton aides pass in and out each with his own special problem
 thornburg arrived with the writers
 they had spent the morning revising the act eliminating all the gay songs patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations 8
 what remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified as befitting the tragic circumstances
 raymond fox reported that the orchestra had hastily rehearsed cradle song in case it was needed
 charlie marble was back and forth on several occasions first to confer with andy on the advisability of cancelling the las vegas engagement- they decided it was wise- and later to announce that a prominent comedian also an agency client had agreed to fill the casino's open date
 and once bake slipped in pale and drawn last night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it
 he asked if there was anything he could do
 andy invented a job to keep him busy sending him ahead to el dorado to supervise last minute arrangements
 but from rocco vecchio they heard nothing
 at last it was time to depart
 hub nosing about spotted reporters in the lobby so andy was hustled away quietly through the hotel's service entrance in a strange car which hub had procured somewhere
 they succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel but there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub
 el dorado was surrounded by a mob
 they overflowed the parking lot making progress by automobile difficult
 long before he reached the protection of the stage door andy was recognized
 word of his arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire 9
 they surged around him fingers pointing eyes prying 9
 it was not a hostile gathering but andy sensed the difference from last night's hero-worshippers
 they had come not to admire but to observe 11
 it's worse inside thornburg informed andy
 skolman's jammed in every table he could find
 under the heading of it's an ill wind et cetera
 backstage was tomblike by contrast
 andy's co-workers kept their distance awed by the tragedy 8
 but in his dressing room was a large bouquet and a card that read we're with you all the way
 it was signed by everyone in the troupe
 andy couldn't help but be touched
 he instructed shirl winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted on the call board
 bake was waiting to report that lou duvol had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently
 andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment 8
 bake himself looked better; any kind of job was better than brooding
 andy told him bake i wish you'd talk to skolman see if some kind of p a system can be rigged up outside
 it's just barely possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get a table
 i wouldn't want him to miss the message
 skolman isn't going to like it much though giving away what he should be selling
 skolman wasn't the only one who didn't care for andy's scheme 9
 a short time later lieutenant bonner stomped into the dressing room
 i got a bone to pick with you mr paxton
 andy rolled up the revised script he had been studying 7
 what about them? 20
  they're going to louse me up good
 my men have been here all afternoon setting up for this thing 8
 bonner explained that with the nightclub's cooperation the police had occupied el dorado like a battlefield
 motion picture cameras had been installed to film the audience the reservation list was being checked out name by name and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead
 however it was virtually impossible to screen the mob outside even if bonner had manpower available for the purpose
 i want you to have the speakers taken out
 seems like we're never going to see eye to eye lieutenant 6
 didn't they tell you what i wanted the p a system for? 8
    sure i know
 but it's such a long shot-   no longer than yours 7
 what do you expect to get tonight anyway? 15
  you think somebody is going to stand up in the audience and make guilty faces? 12
  or have a sign on his car that says 'here comes the paxton kidnapper'? 6
  andy crumbled the script in his fist
 i can't stop you from doing what you think is right 5
 but don't try to stop me either
 someday bonner said you're going to ask us for help 6
 what you don't understand is that i'm asking for it now 9
 but bonner departed still full of ill will
 he had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination; he had to cling to routine tested procedures
 to act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness 10
 but admit or not bonner was helpless
 the crime showed too much planning the kidnappers appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist
 andy's performance was scheduled for eleven o'clock 9
 he stalled for a half-hour longer hoping to hear something from vecchio about the ransom money
 bake and shirl winter on separate telephones could not reach him at any conceivable location in los angeles nor could they secure any clear-cut information regarding his efforts
 the sweaty bastard's probably halfway to peru with our money by now
 when no one smiled he felt constrained to add just kidding natch
 thornburg popped in to advise andy skolman's sending up smoke signals
 you about ready? 24
    what's he complaining about? 7
  bake asked
 they're drinking aren't they? 4
  no
 we got a bunch of sippers out there tonight
 i guess nobody wants to pass out and miss anything 10
 thornburg added in a lower voice but andy overheard they act more like a jury than an audience
 andy said well i guess we can't wait a ny longer 8
 hub you stick by the stage door
 if rock shows up during the number- or you hear anything- give me the signal
 shirl winter said i'll stay on the phone mr paxton 6
 there's a couple of call-backs i can work on
 you're a sweetheart- but leave one line open
 he may try to phone us
 andy passed into the corridor their good lucks! following him 6
 it was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded different as if he really needed it
 the act cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone 5
 the result had nothing of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night
 here's where luck would normally step in
 but this was no ordinary show and andy knew it 13
 whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it 9
 the audience had come not to be entertained but to judge 11
 twenty-four hours had changed him from a performer to a freak 5
 within this framework what followed was strained even macabre 10
 eliminating the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs of equal melancholy
 the effect was as depressing as a gravestone the applause irresolute and short-lived
 yet andy plowed ahead mouthing the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning and gradually his listeners warmed to him 6
 their clapping grew more fervent; the evening was still not beyond salvaging not as a show but for him as a person
 the worst was yet to come
 as andy reached the finale of his act a subdued commotion backstage drew his attention to the wings
 rocco vecchio- a perspiring haggard vecchio- was standing there flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored transport guards 5
 vecchio was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase he held
 andy felt his heart thud heavily with relief
 he waved at fox to cut off the finale introduction 11
 the music died away discordantly
 he drew a deep breath
 ladies and gentlemen in place of my regular closing number tonight i'd like to sing something of a different nature for you 5
 ray if you please- the 'cradle song'
 he sensed rather than heard the gasp that swept across the audience
 nor could he blame them
 this particular song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency
 having no choice he plunged into it anyway holding onto the microphone for support
 lullaby and goodnight h   his voice shook
 for the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest 12
 he wondered if the audience would let him finish 9
 they did; though contemptuous they were still polite 11
 but when he was finally through their scorn was made apparent 12
 someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped 10
 otherwise the silence was complete
 as the lights came up andy could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward the exit
 my god he muttered
 hub was there to support him
 the money's here all of it
 at this moment all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo
 did you hear them? 10
  do you know what they think of me? 19
  bunch of damn jerks hub growled
 who needs them? 18
  thornburg patted his arm
 sure andy it'll be all right
 nothing broken that can't be mended
 thornburg knew better than any of them that a public image was as fragile as humpty dumpty
 all the king's horses and all the king's men h   vecchio shouldered in
 god knows how but i got it
 you'll never believe the places i've been today 3
 i practically had to sign your life away you'll probably fire me for some of the deals i had to go for but-   andy nodded dully 9
 we've done our part
 he clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing room
 the usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent; the place had the air of a morgue
 andy had no desire to linger himself but hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the efforts of the police to disperse them
 his son watched until he got as far as the hall almost out of sight then hurried after
 he caught up with the old man in the living room
 old man arthur had put down the suitcase to open the front door 7
 just this one favor dad
 just don't tell ferguson that crazy opinion of yours 7
 why not? 23
  the old man gave the room a stare in leaving; under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory 5
 the bartlett girl was killed by mr dronk's son 10
 rossi and ferguson have been across the street talking to the kid
 they've found some sort of new evidence a bundle of clothes or something and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime 5
 why won't you accept facts? 10
  the two kids were together a lot they were having some kind of teen-age affair- god knows how far that had gone- and the kid's crippled
 he limps and the man who hit you and took the cane he limped 6
 my god how much more do you want? 10
    his father looked him over closely
 you sound like an old woman
 you should have gone to work today 'stead of sneaking around spying on the dronk house
 now see here-   the trouble with you old man arthur began and then checked himself
 young mrs arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits
 the old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight 12
 isn't enough time to go into it he finished and slammed the door in his son's face
 mrs holden turned from the window draperies
 they found something else up there she said half-aloud to the empty room
 they took it away overalls or something
 she walked restlessly across the room then back to the windows 8
 now they've gone they didn't come back and they didn't arrest that dronk boy
 she stood frowning and chewing her lip
 she was wearing a brown cotton dress cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below
 she smoothed the skirt sat down then stood up and went back to the windows
 why on earth did i send him off to work? 11
  there was excuse enough to keep him home h that young mr arthur's still over there
 with sudden energy she went to the phone and rang holden's office and asked for him
 i think you had better come home
 mr crosson's been on everybody's neck an order he expected didn't come through and he's-   i don't care
 i'm all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous
 i need someone to go out and find out what's happening 10
 but i couldn't do that even if i were home! his voice grew high and trembling
 i can't be underfoot every time those cops turn around! they'll h they'll think i did something
 he couldn't see the grin that split her mouth; the teeth that shone into the phone were like a shark's
 you'll just have to risk it
 you can't wander along in the dark can you? 7
  i'd think that you h even more than i h would be wondering what they're up to
 they found some clothes she tossed in
 what? 19
  deliberately she ignored the yelp
 also that mr ferguson was here
 i guess he wants to ask you some questions
 he doesn't expect you until five
 then i'd better wait until five
 no h o h o
 she slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped away 7
 her eyes were bright with anticipation
 in his office mr holden replaced the phone slowly 10
 he rose from his chair
 he had to cough then; he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face
 he got his hat out of the closet
 for a moment he thought of going into crosson's office to explain that he had to leave but there was now such a pain in his chest such a pounding in his head that he decided to let it go
 he passed the receptionist in the outer office muttering i've got to go out for a little while
 let her call crosson if she wanted to let crosson raise the roof or even can him he didn't care
 he got into the car
 putting the key into the switch pressing the accelerator with his foot putting the car into reverse seemed vast endeavors almost beyond the ability of his shaking body
 once out in the street the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken
 when he turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears
 what on earth was in mae's mind that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing? 7
  what did she think he could do? 10
    he tried to ignore what his own common sense told him but it wasn't possible; her motives were too blatant
 she wanted him to get into trouble
 she wanted the police to notice him suspect him 10
 she was going to keep on scheming poking prodding suggesting and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions
 and he knew in that moment with a cold sinking of despair a dying of old hop es that mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors
 nothing bald open; but enough
 they'd have some suspicions to repeat to the police 8
 though his inner thoughts cringed at it he forced himself to think back recreating the scene in which mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child
 it hadn't amounted to anything
 there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions 11
 a second scene flashed before his mind the interior of the garage at the new house and the young bartlett girl turning startled to meet him the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as mae had clicked on the light
 suppose the cops somehow got hold of that? 8
    well it hadn't been what it seemed he'd had no idea the girl was in there
 and when he came to examine the scene there was a certain staginess to it it had the smell of planning and a swift suspicion darted into his mind
 mae wouldn't have plotted a thing like that
 it was just that little accidents played into her hands 11
 he leaned on the wheel clutching it staring into the sunlight and tried to bring order into his thoughts
 he felt light-headed and sick
 there was no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare
 she was married to him for better or for worse
 she wouldn't be wilfully planning his destruction 12
 even as the conviction of truth roared through him shattering his last hope of safety he was reaching to release the hand brake to head up the road for home doing her bidding
 he drove and the road wobbled familiar scenes crept past on either side
 he came to a stretch of old orange groves the trees dead some of them uprooted and then there was an outlying shopping area and tract houses
 he had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide
 but he couldn't imagine where
 there was really no place to go finally except home to mae 14
 at the gate he slowed looking around
 cooper was beside his car on the curb at the right just standing there morosely; he didn't even look up
 behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man arthur; he was straight something angry in his attitude as if he might be waiting to report something
 holden stepped on the gas
 a new idea drifted in from nowhere
 he could go to the police
 he could tell them his fears of being involved he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him- the scene was complete in his mind at the moment even to his own jerkings and snivelings and ferguson's silent patience
 he could throw himself on the mercy of the police department 13
 it wasn't what mae would want him to do though
 he was sure of this
 once he had abandoned himself to the very worst once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense there wouldn't be very much for mae to do
 at that moment holden almost slammed on the brakes to go back to cooper and ask if ferguson was about
 it would be such a relief
 what was that old sign supposed to be painted over a door somewhere abandon hope all ye who enter here? 9
  why holden said to himself surprised at his own sudden insight i'll bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be
 they've worried they've lain awake nights they've shook at the slightest footstep they've pictured their own destruction and now it's all over and they can give up
 sure they're giving up hope
 hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension 10
 holden waved a hand at the empty street
 glad to see you go
 he drove into the paved space before the garage and got out slamming the car door
 he looked up and down the street
 if ferguson's car had been in sight holden would have walked directly to it
 he went to the front door and opened it and looked in 14
 mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen 6
 she had a cup of something steaming coffee perhaps in one hand a fresh piece of toast in the other
 she stood there watching holden come in and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth
 mae- i've been thinking she said swallowing the toast 8
 didn't you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage? 6
  you used them that time you painted the porch at our other house 7
 and then you wiped up some grease
 she had caught him off guard no preparation nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster
 what do you-   i've been looking for them and they're gone 10
 i'm sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago 8
 you used to paint in them and then you just took them for rags 7
 the police have them now
 i don't remember any overalls at all
 worn through at the knees
 she stood sipping and chewing and watching
 green paint wasn't it? 12
  well i'm not sure of the color
 mae sit down
 put down the cup of coffee
 tell me what this is all about
 she took another bite of toast
 holden noticed almost absently how she chewed how the whole side of her cheek moved a slab of fat that extended down into her neck 6
 my goodness you ought to remember if i do
 you're going to have to go to the police and explain what happened
 tell them the truth h or something h before they come here 6
 a seeping coldness entered holden's being; his nerves seemed frost-bitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glass-like liable to break like an icicle at any moment 6
 i've never owned any painting overalls
 a man with a sketch pad in hand sat with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long dim corridor and made pencil lines on paper and said is this more like it mrs macready? 8
  or are the eyebrows more like this? 9
  when he had finished with that he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same things to someone else most probably a busboy
 begin to look like him now would you say? 8
  different about the mouth huh? 11
  more like this maybe? 15
    men blew dust on objects in a room on the seventeenth floor of the hotel dumont and blew it off again and did the same in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the west forties
 and men also used vacuum cleaners in both rooms sucking dust up once more
 men from the third detective district eighteenth precinct had the longest the most tedious job
 at the hotel dumont there had at the time in issue been twenty-three overnighters counting couples as singular
 these included as one mr and mrs anthony payne who had checked in a little after noon the day before and had not checked out together 6
 but gardner willings was not included; he had been at the dumont for almost a week
 there was of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel 13
 the twenty-three provided merely a place to start and their identification was the barest of starts
 with names and addresses listed verification came next 11
 it would take time; it would almost inevitably trouble some water
 not at the dumont last night and my husband couldn't have been 11
 he's the hotel king arthur across the street provided almost twice as many problems
 the king arthur offered respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburbs who wanted to see a show and didn't want- heaven knew didn't want!- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets to railroad stations and at odd hours of night drive from smaller stations to distant homes probably through rain or in november something worse
 the king arthur was less expensive than the dumont 9
 the king arthur had fifty-four overnighters again counting rooms rather than people
 failing to find what was wanted as was most likely check out other guests with special- but not exclusive- attention to those with rooms on the street
 and know while all this went on that there was no real reason to suppose that the murderer had been a guest in either hotel 7
 it was not even certain the shot had been fired from either hotel 10
 there were other roofs less convenient but not impossible 16
 it is dull business detecting and hard on feet 13
 there was also the one salient question to ask and ask widely: did you notice anything out of the way? 11
  like for example a man carrying a twenty-two rifle probably with a telescopic sight attached? 6
    there was of course no hope it really would be that simple 15
 the sniper whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent would hardly have walked to his vantage point with rifle over shoulder whistling a marching tune
 anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle? 9
  long thin suitcase? 14
  or long fat suitcase for that matter? 11
  shrugs met that from room clerks from bellhops
 who measures? 23
  but nothing it appeared long enough to attract attention 9
 cases say for musical instruments? 10
  none noted at the dumont
 several at the king arthur
 a combo was staying there
 and had been for a week
 anything else? 12
  anything at all? 15
  shrugs met that
 thought for a time he might be on to something
 a refuse bin at the dumont turned up a florist's box- a very long box for very long-stemmed flowers
 traces of oil on green tissue? 9
  the lab to check
 anything at all strange? 13
  well a man had tried at the king arthur to register with an ocelot
 at the dumont a guest had come in a collapsible wheel chair 11
 at the king arthur one guest had had his head heavily bandaged and another had a bandaged foot and had walked with crutches 6
 there had also been a man who must have had st vitus or something because he kept jerking his head
 as reports dribbled in william weigand tossed them into the centrifuge which had become his head
 there was no sign of mrs lauren payne at her house on nod road ridgefield connecticut
 the house was modern large on five acres
 the state cops would check from time to time; pass word when there was word to pass
 weigand tossed this news into the centrifuge
 sort things out damn it
 sort out the next move
 try to forget motive for the moment
 only those actually with payne when he was shot or who had left the party within not more than five minutes positively had none 7
 the norths; hathaway jerry's publicity director; livingston birdwood producer of uprising
 they had been with payne when he was shot could not therefore have shot him from above
 he had left after the scuffle; had been seen to leave 10
 he would have had ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait his prey
 consider him seriously therefore? 17
  intangibles entered then- hunches which felt like facts 7
 willings would ambush certainly; willings undoubtedly had 9
 willings was presumably a better than average shot 8
 but- hunch now- willings would not ambush anything which went on two legs instead of four
 because if for no other reason willings would never for a moment suppose he was not bigger tougher than anything else that went on two legs
 ambushes are laid by those who doubt themselves as any man may against a tiger
 faith constable had had to go on from the party and had presumably gone on
 to be checked out further
 forget motive? 12
  no motive is a part of fact
 nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century-old dereliction
 grudges simply do not keep that well in a sane mind 8
 faith constable had accomplished much in a quarter of a century 8
 jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong? 8
  bill shook his head
 also he thought i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun
 lauren herself? 12
  she had left the party early pleading a headache 12
 no lack of opportunity presuming she had a gun
 she might conceivably have brought one in in a large-enough suitcase
 she might now have taken it away again
 motive- her husband wandering? 13
  bitter unreasoning jealousy? 10
  heaven knew it happened and hell knew it too
 but- it happened almost always among the primitive and usually among the very young
 there was nothing to indicate that lauren payne was primitive 20
 she did not move in primitive circles
 she was young but not that young
 it occurred to bill weigand that he was on a hunch basis eliminating a good many
 he reminded himself that all eliminations were tentative 12
 he also reminded himself that he had an unusual number of possibilities
 the masons mother or son or mother and son? 10
  opportunity was obvious
 here too the cause to hate lay well back in the years 12
 but bitterness had more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode
 the boy had apparently- if mrs macready was right in what she had told mullins- only in recent months been forced to give up college to work as a busboy
 seeing the man he blamed for this made much of- youth and bitterness and- bill picked up the telephone; got mullins 5
 send out a pickup on mrs mason and the boy when you've got enough to go on bill said
 a man named lars simon playwright-director had expressed a wish that anthony payne drop dead
 he would say of course that he had not really had any such wish; that what he had said was no more than one of those things one does say lightly meaning nothing
 which probably would turn out to be true; which he obviously had to be given the opportunity to say
 a man named blaine smythe with y and e but pronounced without them had been fired at payne's insistence
 he was also if pam north was right a closer acquaintance of lauren payne's than she now was inclined to admit
 he might deny the latter; would certainly deny any connection between the two things or any connection of either with murder 8
 he would have to be given the opportunity
 mullins? 19
  it was evident that mullins was the man to go 12
 it was evident that a captain should remain at his desk directing with a firm hand and keeping a firm seat
 bill weigand was good and tired of the wall opposite and the crack in the plaster
 let mullins keep the firm seat; let stein
 when siamese cats are intertwined it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins
 stilts and shadow on pam's bed appeared to be one cat- rather large as siamese cats go and to be sure having two heads and two tails 7
 on the other hand they or it seemed to have no legs whatever 15
 pamela north said hi to her cats and added that proper cats met their humans at the door
 of four dark brown ears one twitched slightly at this 8
 i know it isn't dinnertime
 but at this the one too-large cat suddenly became two cats stretching
 shadow the more talkative began at once to talk her voice piteous
 stilts a more direct cat leaped from the bed and trotted briskly toward the kitchen
 shadow looked surprised wailed and trotted after her 8
 the hell it isn't dinnertime two waving tails told pam north 7
 it was not whatever tale was told by tails
 she might be firm
 it was most unlikely that she would be firm 17
 they want to be fat cats pam thought and lighted a cigarette and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together 6
 after a time it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth the trouble
 a vague feeling that anthony payne had had it coming was hardly a thought and was in any event reprehensible
 had faith constable's explanation of her confidence so uninvited been a little thin? 8
  that was more like a thought but not a great deal more 12
 had that tall dark boy carrying trays too heavy for him found what he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more than he could bear? 7
  and possessed himself- how? 13
 - of a rifle and killed? 6
  pam found she had no answers; had only a hope
 the poor kid- the poor frail kid
 some people have luck and some have no luck and that whatever people who prefer order say is the size of it
 the poor unlucky-   the telephone rang
 pam realized to her surprise that she had been almost dozing 8
 at four o'clock in the afternoon
 two martinis for lunch- that was the trouble
 you do remember
 you just- hello? 19
  yes this is she? 11
  what? 15
    the voice had music in it
 even with words coming too fast they came on the music of the voice
 i said i would pam said
 they won't talk about who gave the information 10
 not unless they have to
 not unless they have-   she was interrupted 10
 call this a cry for help faith constable said
 through a door conveniently unlocked madden supplemented 8
 that damn door said the police chief
 a gift horse to be viewed with suspicion
 madden's dark face wore a meditative look
 if there was collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door later
 and it makes a very poor red herring for an inside job 11
 much better to break a cellar window
 don't forget there was the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling reminded him
 well with a house as big as that there must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation
 and a pane of glass isn't hard to-   the telephone interrupted him 9
 he scooped up the receiver and said police chief into the mouthpiece and then oh yes mr benson
 i was hoping i'd hear from you today
 with his free hand he pulled a pad and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened saying uh-huh and i see at intervals
 at last he said well thank you for calling mr benson 14
 although there was no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one i'm glad to have it made official
 coroner he said to madden
 he's just heard from the pathologist who says mrs meeker apparently died from suffocation
 pauling looked at his notes
 many minute hemorrhages in the lungs; particles of lint and thread in the mouth and nostrils
 scrapings from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities
 no other cause of death apparent
 trachea clear of mucus and foreign objects
 brain examined for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage
 no signs of these no gross hemorrhage of lungs heart brain or stomach
 oh the time of death
 the duration of the digestive process varies the pathologist says but the empty stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that mrs meeker died several hours after her seven-o'clock dinner
 probably around midnight give or take an hour either way 7
 so there it is he said
 not your problem of course unless johnston and the murderer are one and the same
 however likely it was pauling said he couldn't limit himself to it
 he had to look for other prospects other motives until more conclusive evidence pointing to johnston came to light 6
 madden with his investigation centered on the fraud said that tomorrow he would go to the bronx bank through which mrs meeker's checks to johnston had cleared
 arthur williams had to be located they agreed
 he might have been in collusion with johnston on the fraud; he might be mrs meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death 7
 this was madden's suggestion; the police chief shook his head over it
 if arthur williams was involved in the fraud or the murder then he too had another identity
 no one the medfield police had questioned professed to know any more about him than about johnston
 scholarship applicant? 19
  pauling looked doubtful
 madden explained that he was thinking of an application sent directly to mrs meeker
 then he asked to use the phone and called brian thayer who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two o'clock
 madden said that he would see him at two and made another call this one to mrs meeker's lawyers
 mr hohlbein was out for the day but mr garth would be free at one-thirty
 the secretary's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice was a concession for which madden should be duly grateful 6
 he inferred that hohlbein and garth were high-priced lawyers 8
 he had lunch with pauling
 promptly at one-thirty he entered hohlbein and garth's elegant suite of offices in medfield's newest professional building 5
 he disliked garth on sight conservative clothes and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into his thirties handclasp too consciously quick and firm
 youngish man on the make madden labeled him and was ready to guess that in a correct not too pushing fashion the junior partner of the firm had political ambitions; that mrs garth would be impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer; that there were three children two boys and a girl; that she was active in the woman's club and he in lions rotary and jaycee; and finally that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their wedding day 4
 madden knew that he could be completely wrong about all this but also knew that he would go right on disliking garth
 garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste as this unfortunate johnston affair which would not he said more than once have ever come about if mrs meeker had only seen fit to consult mr hohlbein or him about it
 madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement
 he asked to see a copy of mrs meeker's will
 the date october 8 1957 immediately caught the inspector's eye 9
 was she in the habit of making new wills? 8
    oh no
 she had reason to change the one she made right after mr meeker's death
 her estate had grown considerably
 she wanted to make a more equitable distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most; particularly the scholarship fund 6
 at the time the will was drawn mr hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth
 mr hohlbein and i have noticed some lapses since though 9
 most of them this past year i'd say
 even two or three years ago i doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate johnston affair
 she'd have consulted us you see
 she always did before and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised
 the inspector nodded doubting this
 mrs meeker hadn't struck him as ready to seek anyone's advise least of all garth's
 with her sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons 9
 it would have been hohlbein who handled her affairs 17
 madden settled back to read the will
 he skimmed over the millions that went to meeker park medfield hospital the civic center the public health nursing association the library and so on pausing when he came to the scholarship fund
 two millions were added to what had been set aside for it in mrs meeker's lifetime and the proviso made that as long as brian thayer continued to discharge his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustees he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would entail 6
 a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden reflected 8
 he went on to personal bequests a list of names largely unknown to him
 twenty-five thousand to each of the great-nieces in oregon ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand to another; to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollars; to the pecks ten thousand each; to joan sheldon the conditional bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was still in mrs meeker's employ at the time of the latter's death
 birthday; mrs meeker hadn't got around to taking care too bad madden thought
 joan sheldon had earned the larger bequest
 mr hohlbein was left twenty thousand garth ten 10
 there were no other names madden recognized
 arthur williams's might well have been included he felt 8
 mrs meeker had spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for him in her will if he should be found after her death and had never mentioned his name to her lawyers 4
 madden took up this point with garth who shrugged it off 7
 old people have their idiosyncrasies
 this one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more 9
 well she had a number of them where money was concerned garth said 8
 sometimes we'd have trouble persuading her to make tax-exempt charitable contributions and i've known her to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet; the next moment she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate johnston affair
 there was no telling how she'd react to spending money 13
 madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund 7
 there was an annual audit garth informed him 15
 no discrepancies or shortages had ever been found 11
 brian thayer was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator
 his salary had reached the ten thousand mark 10
 his expenses ran another four or five thousand
 the lawyer didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party- thayer like himself madden reflected was the extra man so prized by hostesses- and found him easy enough to talk to
 but he didn't play golf didn't seem to belong to any local clubs- his work took him away a lot of course- which probably accounted for his tendency to keep to himself
 garth's glance began to flicker to his watch
 he said that he had already told the police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended johnston to mrs meeker 7
 he would offer no theory to account for her murder 12
 the whole thing his manner conveyed was so far outside the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug
 no doubt mrs meeker had snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing
 even so madden's dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepened 8
 it would be all right with him he decided if his investigation of the fraud with its probable by-product of murder led to garth's door 8
 at first glance not much of a motive for a man of his standing; but for all his air of affluence who could tell what his private financial picture was? 6
    the inspector knew as he left that this was wishful thinking 11
 nevertheless he made a mental note to look into garth's financial background
 brian thayer had a downtown address
 he lived in an apartment house not over three or four years old a reclaimed island of landscaped brick and glass on the fringe of the business district
 he occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor using the second bedroom as his office
 airy and bright the apartment was furnished with good modern furniture rugs and draperies
 done by a professional decorator madden thought and somehow as impersonal as unremarkable as its occupant
 in dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month; in medfield perhaps twenty-five less not all of it paid by thayer who could charge off one room on his expense account
 he took madden into the room he used as an office 11
 it contained a desk files a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchairs
 a newspaper open at stock-market reports lay on one of them 9
 thayer folded it up and offered a drink
 to begin the interview he asked if thayer with more time to think it over could add to what he had said the other day about johnston 8
 it's all i think about too
 it's still unbelievable that it was murder
 for all her domineering ways i can't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy
 dammit phil are you trying to wreck my career? 8
  because that's what you're doing- wrecking it wrecking it wrecking it! griffith had confronted hoag on the building's front steps- hoag had been permitted no further- and backed him against a wrought-iron railing
 his rage had built up as he made his way here from the second floor helped by the quantity of champagne he had consumed
 hoag said i didn't send for you leigh
 i want the captain in charge
 where is he? 14
    phil for god's sake go away
 i told you there's nothing between midge and me nothing 10
 it's all in your mind
 a couple of sobs escaped him followed by a sentiment that revealed his emotional state
 why i'm not fit to touch the hem of her garment
 leigh get a grip on yourself
 it's not about you or midge
 i have some security information about the prime minister 12
 griffith looked at him suspiciously through red-rimmed eyes 9
 not about me? 15
  you mean it phil? 20
  you wouldn't pull my leg old man? 11
  i did get you on the platform this morning
 i'm not pulling your leg
 will you call that captain? 14
  no use he won't come
 he peered closely at hoag in the gathering darkness 11
 what happened to your head? 16
  i was hit- knocked out
 now will you get him? 10
    he says i'm to take the message
 he stared at hoag drunkenly
 who'd hit you in the head? 10
    it doesn't matter
 you get back to the captain and tell him this: somebody's going to take a shot at the prime minister and mahzeer is in on the plot 8
 tell him under no circumstances to trust the prime minister with mahzeer
 mahzeer's the ambassador
 griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it
 i'll show you how wrong you are
 mahzeer and the prime minister are alone right now 7
 so that proves it!   hoag looked terrified
 where are they? 12
    where'd you expect the john? 10
  mahzeer's office
 where is that? 17
    facing us two flights up
 look old man you can't go up
 they won't even let you in the front door
 so why don't you be a good boy and- hoag grabbed him by the shoulders
 if you want to spend another day in the state department- another day- you get in there and tell that captain what i told you 8
 he bit out the words
 and you know i can do it
 easy does it phil
 i'm on my way
 he turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back
 on the second landing he paused to look for docherty didn't see him and accepted a glass of champagne
 he took several large swallows recollected that docherty had gone up another flight and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him
 the way hoag was no telling what he might say or do 8
 he finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing
 at the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress 13
 yes what is it? 14
  he asked
 he spotted docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him
 docherty said it's okay bonfiglio let him by
 they walked toward each other
 well? 15
    griffith said hoag told me to tell you- he waited until they were close; it was hideously embarrassing- not to let the prime minister be alone with mahzeer
 griffith looked half-crocked to the captain; it would be just like him
 why not? 23
    he claims mahzeer's in a plot to kill the pm 8
 docherty went taut: was it possible? 9
  could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared? 6
  not possible he thought; the prime minister knew who his enemy was here; he wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter
 and if by some wild chance mahzeer was the man he wouldn't dare try anything now- not after docherty had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well
 docherty was damned if he would make a fool of himself again the way he had earlier over the laundry truck
 one more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away
 still this had to be checked out
 where'd your friend hoag get his information? 7
  he asked
 would you mind sending him up here? 12
  i'd like to talk to him
 troubled he continued along the corridor poking his head into the next office for a careful look around
 but hoag had not stayed on the front steps when griffith disappeared into the building
 he was unwilling to rely on griffith's carrying his message and he had no confidence the police would act on it
 if mahzeer was alone with the prime minister he could be arranging his execution while hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street
 he would have to do something on his own
 but what? 29
    the door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs
 in the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps
 these were the early departures; in half an hour the reception would be over
 if mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister for muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes
 hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building
 wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories
 on the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests; the scene looked like a christmas card
 on the third floor one of the two windows was lighted; it was framed in maroon drapes and no faces were visible
 this would be mahzeer's office
 he and the prime minister would be back from the window seated at mahzeer's desk; they would be going over papers mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting
 in a minute or five minutes the business would be done; mahzeer would stand up the prime minister would follow
 mahzeer would direct the prime minister's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side 6
 the single shot would come; hoag would carry its sound to his grave
 mahzeer of course would be desolate
 how was he to suspect that an assassin had been lurking somewhere across the street waiting for just such a chance? 6
  hoag turned
 where across the street? 11
  where was muller waiting with the rifle? 14
  narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf
 most of them could be eliminated; muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite
 the legation was generously set back from the building line; if the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere
 would the shot come from a roof? 14
  he ran his eye along the roof copings; almost at once a figure bulked up
 but dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman
 with a cop patrolling the road muller would have to be inside a building- if he was here at all and not waiting for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal building at la guardia airport
 hoag crossed the narrow street squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk
 from this side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window but he saw no faces; the room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain 4
 if only the latter were true h
 he walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades: one was a club- that was out; two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted
 that left three possibly four one looking much like the next 11
 he climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule
 he quickly closed it again
 he had assumed that all these buildings had been divided into apartments but this one from a glance at the hall furnishings was obviously still a functioning town house and its owners were in residence; that made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance
 he went on to the next building and found what he expected- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule
 on one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes; there were six apartments
 now what? 22
  the names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him
 this was senseless- he had no idea what to look for 11
 he peered in the boxes themselves; all were empty except one and that one was jammed with letters and magazines
 the occupants of apartment number 3 were probably away for a few days and not likely to return on a friday
 had muller made the same deduction? 10
  muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes
 he opened the inner door; the cooking odors were stronger- all over the city at this hour housewives would be fussing over stoves 6
 he climbed as quickly as he could urge his body up the two unbroken flights to the third floor pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade all that remained of the building's beauty 7
 he paused on the landing to steady his breathing and then bent to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead 6
 now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to muller's collection of keys; fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open
 it had been shut again but the lock was broken; he noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch
 what was he to do now? 17
  he had thought no further than finding muller 10
 he realized now he had more than half hoped he wouldn't find him- that muller would not be here that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond hoag's control
 he could not break in on an armed man
 he would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop
 was there time? 13
    his thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door
 hoag pushed open the door: at the far end of the long dark room muller was faintly silhouetted against the window the rifle still raised; he stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill
 he turned his head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and his rifle sight dismissing hoag for the moment with the same contempt he had shown in their encounter at hoag's apartment
 hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark
 the room was bathed in light at the instant muller's second shot came
 muller nakedly exposed at the bright window like a deer pinned in a car's headlights threw down the rifle and turned to jump from the table; his face wore a look of outrage
 a shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain; a following volley of shots shattered glass ripped the ceiling and sent him lurching heavily from the table
 he was dead before his body made contact with the floor 10
 hoag stumbled back into the hall leaned against the wall and started to retch
 after captain docherty sent arleigh griffith for hoag he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from his man covering the floors above before griffith returned buoyed up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne 5
 the safe at ingleside district station stands next to the gum machine in a narrow passageway that leads to captain harris's office the lieutenant's office and the janitor's supply closet 7
 the safe is a repository for three dead flashlight batteries a hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint cards a stack of unsold policemen's ball tickets from last year and thirty-seven cents in coins and stamps
 gun set the captain's fifth of hiram walker inside the safe before he reported to lt killpath though he knew that killpath's ulcer prevented him from making any untoward incursion on herman wolff's gift
 it was more a matter of tact and also it was none of killpath's goddam business
 he walked up to the lieutenant's office leaned wearily against the gun rack that housed four rifles and a gas gun nobody remembered having used and a submachine gun that was occasionally tried out on the academy range
 he stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes
 where's the lieut? 13
    the clerk wagged his head toward the captain's office 8
 gun went to the connecting door which was open and stood at attention while orville torrence killpath in full uniform finished combing his hair
 the lieutenant's sparse brown hair was heavily pomaded and as killpath raked the comb through it it stuck together in thatches so that it looked like umbrella ribs clinging to his pink skull 4
 the lieutenant eyed gun's reflection in the mirror over the washbowl and then glanced back at his own face moving the comb methodically around his head
 leave me alone gun thought
 fight with sam schaeffer fight with the whole damned bureau 8
 because i'm looking for the son of a bitch that killed that old man and i'm going to get him
 if you just leave me to hell alone lieutenant 14
 killpath peered through half-closed lids at his reflection thrust up his chin in a gesture of satisfaction and about-faced 5
 gun waited for killpath to sit down behind the desk near the window
 he sat stiff-backed in a chair that did not swivel though it was obvious to gun that killpath felt his position as acting captain plainly merited a swivel chair
 the desk before him was in no better repair than the rest of the furniture crowded into the room including wooden file cabinets with some of their pulls yanked off and a wardrobe stained with the roof seepage of countless seasons
 killpath pulled one thin leg up clamping his arms around the shinbone to press his knee into an incredibly scrawny gut 5
 it was the posture which the men had come to recognize as that of killpath defying his ulcer
 he put his chin on his kneecap stretching his neck like that of a turkey on a chopping block and stared wordlessly at his sergeant 5
 the 7:45 bell rang and he could hear the outside doors bang shut closing in the assembled day watch
 finally orville intoned through his hawk nose we can't have people running in any time they please sergeant
 can't have it
 makes for confusion and congestion
 he rocked back in the chair knee locked against stomach his beady eyes fixed on matson
 he was silent again possibly listening to the sounds in the squadroom
 gun cleared his throat
 killpath said you were expected to report to my office twenty minutes ago sergeant
 that's not getting all the juice out of the orange now is it? 5
    no sir
 gun knew that nothing but aces back to back would give the lieutenant an ulcer and a smile at the same time
 the day-watch platoon commander lt rinker was calling out the beat assignments but matson couldn't make the names mean anything 5
 i called the station at three this morning killpath's nasal voice pronounced
 do you have any idea who might have been in charge at the time? 9
    sergeant vaughn sir
 now now you're just guessing sergeant
 he smiled thinly savoring his joke
 what if i said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen? 9
    sir vaughn knows better than to leave the station without a relief
 he must have- he let a patrolman take over the duties of the station keeper
 now that's not regulation is it? 10
    no sir
 but you didn't know a thing about it did you? 11
  killpath leaned forward; his foot slipped off the chair and he put it back again frowning now
 that's not taking one's command with a responsible attitude matson 5
 gun told himself that the old bastard was a fool
 but stupidity was no consolation when it had rank 11
 i was out in the district sir
 he stretched a pale hand out to the scattered papers on his desk
 i might point out that your inability to report to my office this morning when you were instructed to do so has not h ah h limited my knowledge of your activities as you may have hoped 6
 he took up a white sheet of paper dark with single-spaced data 10
 a car pulled into the driveway outside the window
 gun knew it was car 12 the wagon returned from delivering ingleside's drunk-and-disorderlies to the city jail
 but for some fool reason he couldn't remember which men he'd put on the transfer detail
 he stared at the report in killpath's hand sure it was written by accacia- just as sure as if he'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand 7
 he sucked in his breath and kept quiet while killpath laid down the sheet again wound the gold-wire stems of his glasses around his ears and then eying the report as it lay before him on the desk intoned acting lieutenant gunnar matson one failed to see that the station keeper was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch without checking on the station's activities or the whereabouts of his section sergeants three permitted members of the homicide detail of the inspector's bureau to arrogate for their own convenience a patrolman who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment four failed to notify the station commander acting captain o t killpath of a homicide occurring in the district five frequented extralegal establishments known as after-hours spots for purposes of an unofficial and purportedly social nature and six- he leaned back and peeled off his glasses - failed to co-operate with the acting captain by returning promptly when so ordered 4
 what have you to say to that sergeant? 9
  killpath sailed the paper across the desk but matson didn't pick it up or even glance at it
 well? 19
    i didn't think accacia knew so many big words lieutenant 6
 patrolman accacia is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement officer
 i don't think his diligence mitigates your negligence matson 4
 negligence hell! gun held his breath a moment pushing the volume and pitch of his voice down under the trapdoor in his throat 6
 i would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop to boot if i'd sat around this station all night when somebody got away with murder in my district
 it's too bad i didn't call you and it's too bad i let schaeffer use accacia when he could have had a boy who'd be glad to learn something of homicide procedure
 but i'm not one damned bit sorry i went out to question the people i know in the places they hang around and-   let's not push our patience beyond the danger line sergeant killpath nasaled 5
 i shouldn't like to have to write you up for insubordination as well as dereliction of duty
 gun stiffened his hands balling into fists at his sides 6
 he clamped his jaws to keep the fury from spilling out 10
 an argument with orville torrence killpath was as frustrating and as futile as a cap pistol on a firing range
 killpath leaned forward again rocked comfortably with his arms still wrapped around one knee
 let's just remember sergeant that we must all carry our own umbrella
 a district station can't run smoothly unless- he interrupted himself looking around gun at the doorway
 i thought you hadn't come in yet
 i've been here for some time
 he stood up cocked his head and eyed gun coldly 8
 the sergeant is just leaving
 it had come as no great surprise to matson that the hot water in the showers didn't work that loren severe had thrown up all over the stairs or that some thieving bastard of a cop had walked off with his cigarettes
 it was the best he could hope for on a watch that had ended with a session in killpath's office
 now as he passed the open counter that divided the assembly room from the business office he nodded and said good night to the station keeper and his clerks not stopping to hear the day-watch playback of his chewing out
 not that he gave a damn what the grapevine sent out about killpath's little speech on the comportment of platoon commanders 7
 he just didn't want to talk about it
 if the acting captain wanted his acting lieutenant to sit on his ass around the station all night killpath would just have to go out and drag gun back by the heels once an hour; because he'd be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch pencil-pusher just to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain
 at the doorway he squinted up at the gray morning overcast and patted his jacket pockets for the cigarettes remembering then that he'd left them at the doughnuttery
 he could pick up another pack on his way home if he were going home
 but even before he started across the oiled road to his plymouth parked in the lot under the cypress trees across from the station he knew that he wasn't going home
 it was nine o'clock in the morning: the hour which like a spade turning clods of earth exposed to the day a myriad of busy creatures that had lain dormant in the quiet night
 mission street at this hour was populated by a whole community that gun could not have seen on his tour of duty- the neighborhood that had known urbano quintana by day
 sol phillips had purchased the alliance furniture mart seventeen years ago
 it was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will and the name was written in gold in foot-high letters across each of the two display windows
 on the right window at eye level in smaller print but also in gold was gonzalez prop and under that se habla espanol 8
 mr phillips took a razor to gonzalez prop but left the promise that spanish would be understood because he thought it meant that spanish clientele would be welcome
 language was no problem anyway; mr phillips had only to signal from his doorway to summon aid from the ubiquitous bilingual children who played on the sidewalks of mission street
 aside from the fact that business was slow this time of year and his one salesgirl was not the most enterprising mr phillips had no worries at all and he said as much to gun matson who sat across from him in civilian clothes on a jiffy-couch-a-bed mauve velour $79 6
 89 nothing-down special!   she's honest as the day mr phillips said and added mr gunnar i can say this to you: beebe is a little too honest
 you can't tell a customer how much it's going to cost him to refinance his payments before he even signs for a loan on the money down! a time plan is a mere convenience you understand and when- he interrupted himself smiling
 i put her in lamps
 that way i don't lose so much
 why don't you just hire somebody else? 11
  she says she has to finish a story
 i asked her why she couldn't do it tomorrow but it seems the muse is working good tonight and she's afraid to let it go 7
 casey made some comment but his mind was busy as he considered the man
 his name was george needham and he too had come from a good family
 he was perhaps thirty-two nicely set up with light brown hair that had a pronounced wave
 he was always well groomed and well tailored and he had that rich man's look which was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools and a proper university
 an only child he had done all the things that young men do who have been born to money and social position until his father double-crossed him by dying broke
 since then he had worked at this and that though some said his main interest was gambling
 all this went through casey's mind in the first instant but what held his interest was the fact that these two should be together at all
 for he had understood that betty had been engaged to a boy named barry jenkins
 she had grown up with young jenkins and he had heard that they had been at the point of getting married at least twice
 he wanted to ask her about jenkins now but he knew he couldn't do so in needham's presence
 and so still wondering and a little perplexed he grinned at the girl and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding 6
 where did you pick him up? 12
    oh i've known him quite a while
 she glanced at her companion fondly
 haven't i george? 12
    i've been after her for years needham said but i've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days
 the girl's eyes were softly shining as she reached out and touched casey's hand
 can i tell you a secret? 12
  we're going to get married
 do you approve? 30
    casey kept his smile fixed but some small inner disturbance was working on him as he thought again about needham who was eight or ten years older than the girl
 he wondered whether needham was going to swear off gambling and get a steady job or whether he was counting on the income from betty's estate to subsidize him
 none of this showed in his face and he tried to keep his skepticism in hand
 he made a point of frowning of acting out the part of the fond father-confessor
 i'll have to give it some thought he said
 you wouldn't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions are honorable would you? 9
    she made a face at him and then she laughed
 i'll get my references in order needham said and though he spoke with a smile casey somehow got the idea that he was not particularly amused
 stop by any time casey
 he stood up and touched the girl's arm
 if you're really serious about working on that story i'd better take you home
 casey watched them go still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter as he called for his check
 as he went out he told freddie the dinner was perfect and when he got his hat and coat from nancy parks and put a fifty-piece piece in the slot he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry 5
 a taxi took him back to the bar and grill where he had left his car and a few minutes later he found a parking place across the street from his apartment
 because his mind had been otherwise occupied for the past couple of hours he did not think to look and see if jerry burton's car was still there
 in fact he did not think about jerry burton at all until he entered his living room and closed the door behind him
 only then when his glance focused on the divan and saw that it was empty did he remember his earlier problem
 even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket that he had spread over burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it
 then he was striding across the room his thoughts confused but the worry building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note 6
 jack: look in the wastebasket
 i knew the only way i could beat you was to play possum but it was a good try kid and i appreciate it
 j the wastebasket stood near the wall next to the divan and the instant casey picked it up he knew what had happened 6
 the discarded papers inside were sodden there was a glint of liquid at the bottom and the smell of whisky was strong and distinct 6
 he put the basket do wn distastefully muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan that had seemed so foolproof 8
 for he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks to burton and then returned to the kitchen to get weaker drinks for himself
 for another second or two he gave in to the annoyance that was directed at himself; then his mind moved on to be confronted by something far more serious and as the thought expanded the implications jarred him
 it no longer mattered that burton had outsmarted him 6
 the important thing was that burton had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in his pocket
 and that gun was empty
 even before his mind had rounded out the idea he thrust one hand into his trousers pocket and pulled out the six slugs he had taken from the revolver
 he considered them with brooding eyes brows bunched as his brain grappled with the problem and tried to find some solution 6
 he said: the crazy fool half aloud
 he put the shells on the table as though he could no longer bear to hold them
 he thought: where the hell could he have gone? 11
  how can i find him? 13
    there was no answer to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room his imagination out of control
 he tried to tell himself that maybe burton had sobered up enough to get some sense
 maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer whoever he was in which case an unloaded gun would be good enough
 he thought of other possibilities none of them satisfactory and finally he began to think to wonder if there was some way he could reach burton
 then as he turned toward the telephone it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reached for it eagerly 7
 tony calenda
 casey heard the voice distinctly and he knew who it was but it took him a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside his head
 when he heard calenda say: what about that picture you took this afternoon? 8
  it still took him another few seconds to remember the job he had done for frank ackerly
 you took a picture of me at the corner of washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon
 who says so? 18
    one of my boys
 calenda was not the sort who walked around without one of his boys close at hand
 so? 15
    with my trial coming up in federal court next week i wouldn't want that picture published
 who says it's going to be published? 10
  i wouldn't even want it to get around
 under normal circumstances casey was a little fussy when people told him what to do with pictures he had taken
 even so he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections properly
 right now however he was still too worried about jerry burton and the gun that had no bullets and the story burton had told him to care too much about tony calenda
 his nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience put an edge in his voice
 i was hired to take a picture
 that's all i know about it and that's all i care
 maybe you'd better tell the guy who hired you what i said 6
 all right calenda said his voice still quiet 11
 but i meant what i said casey
 if that picture gets around and i find out you had anything to do with it i'm going to send a couple of my boys around to see you
 you do that casey said
 just be sure to send your two best boys tony 11
 he hung up with a bang annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation he had helped to create
 as soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory and found jerry burton's home number 9
 he dialed it and listened to it ring ten times before he hung up 6
 he called the bar and grill where he had picked burton up that afternoon
 when he was told that no one had seen burton since then he thought of three other places that were possibilities
 each time he got the same answer and in the end he gave up 10
 by the time he had smoked three cigarettes he had calmed down 6
 he had done all he could and that was that 14
 and anyway burton was not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk
 he casey had been scared for a while but that had come mostly from the fact that he felt responsible
 he should have stayed here and watched burton 10
 so he made a mistake
 so what? 18
  he kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen to make a drink
 only then did he decide he didn't want one
 he considered opening a can of beer but vetoed that idea too 10
 finally he went into the bedroom and sat down to take off his shoes
 he had just finished unlacing the right one when the telephone rang again
 when he snatched it up the voice that came to him was quick and urgent
 casey? 19
  you don't know me but i know you
 if you want a picture get to the corner of adams and clark just as fast as you can
 if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boys 9
 casey heard the click of the distant receiver before he could open his mouth and it took him no more than three seconds to make his decision
 for over the years he had received many such calls 9
 some of them came from people who identified themselves 18
 some telephoned because he had done them a favor in the past 7
 others because they expected some sort of reward for the information
 a few passed along a tip for the simple reason that they liked him and wanted to give him a break
 only an occasional tip turned out to be a phony and like the police casey had made a point of running down all such suggestions and he did not hesitate this time
 he was in his car with his camera and equipment bag in less than two minutes and it took him only three more to reach the corner a block from columbus avenue
 it was a district of small factories and loft buildings and occasional tenements and he could see the police radio car as he rounded the corner and slammed on the brakes
 he did not bother with his radio- there would be time for that later- but as he scrambled out on the pavement he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned
 the police car had pulled up behind a small sedan its headlights still on
 slowly he pulled out the hand throttle until the boat was moving at little more than a crawl and watched elaine rapidly spin from one station to another tune in the null then draw in a line on the chart
 we're out just a little too far
 make a 90 degree straight for shore
 poet came in raising his eyebrows appreciatively as he saw elaine 7
 pretty quick she replied
 will you drop the anchor? 14
    poet nodded swung below and a moment later emerged from the forward hatch where he picked up the anchor
 the rock and roll music coming from the radio station suddenly faded as the boat coasted into the null on the rdf
 reverse elaine said then peered through the loop of the rdf and waved to poet
 a second later she came behind the wheel and backed off the anchor line until it was set in the ocean floor
 she cut the engines and slowly the cruiser swung around on the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the cockpit faced toward the shore
 nick watched her somewhat enviously as she efficiently cut the engines and started the auxiliary motor
 poet came up from below wearing new bathing trunks 6
 the price tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom and looked at it curiously
 nick wondered if elaine had bought them but he said nothing 6
 nobody he suddenly realized was saying anything 10
 it seemed as if they were all under a spell
 there should be an excited conversation for somewhere directly below them was a treasure lost for more than four hundred years 11
 but instead of chatter there was a null like on the radio direction finder
 once in new york he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane with a single engine
 they had all been laughing joking when suddenly the engine had failed
 no one had prayed
 all had fallen into a complete silence listening to the wind whistle over the wings
 the pilot had been good
 he'd landed the plane on a small airstrip in connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had coasted to a stop everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment
 there had been tension in the plane during the silent descent; a tension similar to the one now
 but in the plane there was a concrete reason for i t 13
 now at this moment there should be none h unless skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe
 the same taut-nerved relationship as there had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three of them here on the boat
 it hung over them like a cloud its arrival as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun
 silently elaine picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit poet behind her nick trailing behind him 5
 she threw back a cushion over one of the seats unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it then presently straightened holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear gun in her hand
 poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun
 they are the best
 she kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion 7
 they are the most efficient
 and the deadliest poet commented as he buckled on his tank harness 8
 why do you need an arsenal? 13
  nick asked apprehensively staring at the weapon
 it's quite possible there's more than codfish down there man poet replied with a short nervous laugh as he held the harness for elaine
 a moment later moving awkwardly because of the swimming fins she picked up the gun handed the knife to poet then rolled off the transom of the boat back first
 poet nodded to nick and entered the water in a similar fashion
 another moment and they were out of sight leaving behind only a string of bubbles as a clue to their whereabouts
 for a while nick followed the twisting course of the bubbles wondering which set came from elaine
 they remained close together their air trail wiggling like serpents traveling side by side
 eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle of the ocean surface and he rolled over on his back
 clasping his hands behind his head he stared at the blue sky 6
 there was nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean 11
 alfredo certainly must have enjoyed being alone 7
 next to the ocean probably the loneliest spot was the desert 12
 if elaine's uncle had stuck to this desire for aloneness he probably would still be alive
 yet alfredo wanted money h wanted money to roam through the deserts
 and graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in las vegas
 it was an odd combination h a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the trinidad
 but graham hadn't stumbled on it
 two to three weeks prior to the charter of the virginia graham had been snooping around the san luis rey mission
 the small helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and nick raised up to watch it heading south
 that was a hell of a note he thought
 a couple couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them 6
 if the character flying that thing had gone over san clemente island yesterday he would have had an eyeful
 off to the west a beautiful schooner slowly beat its way into the wind headed on a tack toward san clemente
 behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small ground-swell a lone fisherman in the chair aft
 the fisherman was right in the middle of the deep 12
 nick recalled stories that the two best fishing spots in southern california were over the la jolla deep and the redondo deep two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic depths almost from the shoreline
 someday geologists had warned the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach 6
 meanwhile fishermen took advantage of them to pull up whoppers 11
 sometimes the fish exploded as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure
 why he wondered had elaine wanted him along on this trip? 8
  he couldn't skindive he couldn't run a boat except on the open sea
 he stood up stretched looked around for the bubbles but could see none
 strolling down to the galley he lit the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew was heated poured himself a cup and went up to the chartroom
 turning on the hi-fi he went back to the cockpit stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music
 elaine and poet returned together popping up over the transom almost like dolphins breaking water
 he sat up and watched as they pulled themselves over the stern 9
 poet shook his head sliding his face mask up on his forehead 6
 we're right on the edge of the deep elaine said 11
 pulling off her face mask she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water
 which is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile she added as she swung her legs over the transom
 any news? 15
  not a thing
 he tossed her a towel then repeated the service for poet 7
 cigarette? 19
    elaine shook her head as she slipped out of her harness but poet nodded
 his feet still hung over the stern of the transom but as he reached for the smoke he raised them to swing them in 7
 the fin on his foot caught on the moulding throwing him off balance
 his forearm smashed painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with his other hand and rolled into the boat
 kee-reist! the word hissed distinctly from poet's lips as he struggled to his feet
 turning slowly he saw poet in a brilliant glare of horror 9
 poet! his face was still creased in pain as he studied the underside of his arm
 poet a murderer? 13
  turning quickly toward elaine nick saw that she too stood in shocked surpris e
 the sudden silence was too silent
 instinctively aware of the charged atmosphere poet raised his head slowly looking first at elaine
 she had caught the implication of the oath
 her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin her body absolutely motionless
 and then nick knew that all of them knew h elaine himself h and poet
 elaine recovered first so quickly that nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction
 do you need a bandage? 12
  she asked steadily
 it's like banging a shin he said his eyes lingered on nick's face then moved back to elaine
 hurts like hell for a second then it disappears
 elaine turned and started toward the companionway
 but her walk was too steady too slow telegraphing her fear 8
 so did poet
 springing like a cat he leaped back swooped up the spring gun and whirling pointed it toward the cabin
 at the same instant nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man
 the gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke of an old steam engine
 at the same instant elaine screamed wildly the sound ending abruptly as nick went off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic struggling poet
 the moment the sea closed over nick some atavistic sense warned him that he would survive in this alien element only if he did not panic
 but the murderer to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage 12
 the wide flippers on poet's feet gave his legs incredible power driving the two of them down into the water as they rolled over and over
 poet was the captured arms pinioned to his side and he twisted convulsively trying to escape
 poet would escape nick thought grimly because he wore the apparatus which would keep him alive under water
 but nick would not let go
 the rubber and glass face mask slipped from poet's forehead bounced painlessly off nick's chin then disappeared
 poet twisted again and nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank ripping off the skin
 for a split second nick relaxed his grip and poet's slippery body spun completely around before nick could stop him holding him now from the rear
 something flailed at the side of nick's head as they rolled around and around
 suddenly poet stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water not rising not sinking
 a sharp pain lanced across nick's chest and a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs joining dozens of others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising into the sky 6
 a black snake-like object swayed eerily in front of him spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head
 the air hose was free! the discovery struck nick like a blow 10
 desperately nick flashed one hand up catching poet's neck in the bend of his elbow
 at the same instant he grabbed the loose writhing hose with his other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece 9
 instinctively he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose
 at once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with a sudden wild exultation
 as if this was a signal poet abruptly began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them sink through the water 8
 relentlessly nick held on sucking on the hose inhaling the air that belonged to poe t
 poet was not fighting nick now
 harbor point sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck of a steamer clam
 it's a rich village but not much for action- too many solid residents not enough tourists or working stiffs
 it's at the far end of the county and the last time i came here was for a hit and run manslaughter- about seven months ago
 chief bob moore looked his same hick-self; a man mountain running to lard in his middle-age
 seeing me he said with real surprise well well ain't we honored! hardly expected the head of county homicide up for this murder 7
 you sure climbed fast jed
 rookie investigator last summer and now it's inspector jed 9
 took me 19 years to become chief of our three man police force 5
 proves a college education pays off
 his sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his thick mouth and bad teeth
 i guess it helps i said paying no attention to his ribbing 9
 never could figure out why you ever wanted to be a cop jed 7
 you're not only young but h well you don't even look like a police officer
 a runt with narrow shoulders and that brush haircut h hell you'd pass for a juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set
 in my day the first requirement for a cop was to look like the law big and tough
 man when my 275 pounds and six-four comes along why it's the same as another badge
 when i say move a guy moves!   don't worry about my being tough moore
 also it's far too early in the day for corny lines like the bigger they come h you've had your gassy lecture let's get to work 6
 who was the murdered woman h mrs buck? 11
  widow nice sort of woman
 came to the harbor as a bride and h don't worry jed this one is in the bag
 i know the killer have the only road off the peninsula covered 9
 yeah passed your road blo ck as i drove in i said sitting on his polished desk
 although bob dressed like a slob he kept a neat office 6
 okay what happened? 13
  about nine this morning mrs buck phones me she's having trouble with one of her farm hands- money trouble
 colored fellow named tim williams- only hand she has working for her now
 tim come with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from the south last year but tim and his wife settled here 5
 never had no trouble with him before thought he was a hard worker hustling around to get a full week's work
 anyway julia asks me to h
 julia? 19
    come on inspector look alive
 julia buck the deceased moore said slipping me his smug idiot-grin again
 julia asks me to come out at once
 but she didn't sound real alarmed h you know like there was any immediate danger
 i got there at 9:47 am found her strangled
 i would have come sooner if i'd known h
 no doubt about tim being the kil ler- i have a witness 9
 don't know why the county had to send anybody up here 4
 told them i can handle this
 yeah seems you have a nice package with all the strings tied 8
 who's h? 12
  i'll collar tim before night
 who's your witness? 12
    julia had- has- an old indian woman cooking for her- nellie harris
 probably the last of the original island indians 14
 nellie was in the kitchen had just come to work when she heard tim arguing with julia in the living room
 swears she recognized his voice that tim yelled 'it's my money and i want it'! and then rushed out of the house
 then she heard julia phone me
 nellie went on with her house work- until i found julia dead 5
 and before you say it nellie ain't near strong enough to have strangled julia
 there's no doubt this tim sneaked back and killed mrs buck 4
 another fact: tim's disappeared- on the run
 but there's no way off the point except through my road block 6
 guess you want to see the body- have her up the street in doc abel's office
 we walked up main street to this big white house then around to the back
 being the harbo rs sole doctor abel was also its medical examiner
 the corpse was on a table covered by a sheet
 doc abel was busy up front with some of his live patients 7
 pulling back the sheet i examined the bruises around julia buck's once slender throat
 powerful hands had killed her
 find any prints? 15
    chief moore shook his big head seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body
 then he said never noticed it before h i mean when she was dressed h but for a woman her age julia had a real fine figure 5
 i dropped the sheet glanced at my watch
 it was almost one and i hadn't had lunch
 still i wanted to get this over with had a lot of paper work waiting in my own office
 i told him i want to go see the buck house
 walking back down main street i said i saw the harbor's one squad car at the road block we'll ride out in my car
 naw we'll use mine moore said opening the door of a sleek white jaguar roadster
 as i slid in beside him he said some heap hey? 11
  got a heck of a buy on this dirt cheap
 yeah it's a real load i told him looking up the street at my battered ford
 five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical two-story house and when the jaguar stopped i managed to swallow
 there was a garage and a modern barn in the rear all of it standing between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes 10
 everything shouted gentleman farming the kind of grandfather-father-to son folding money the point is known for
 the fins of a caddy were sticking out of the garage while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture of old and expensive contemporary furniture
 nellie harris wasn't old she was ancient- a tiny shriveled woman with a face like a tan prune
 she was also stone deaf in her right ear
 she calm ly repeated what moore had told me
 when i asked why didn't you go into the living room to see how mrs buck was? 10
  the old gal stared at me with her hard eyes said she didn't call
 i do the living room last
 i went up stairs and did the bath and her bedroom- way i always do in the morning
 have you any idea what this tim and mrs buck were arguing about? 11
  probably wages
 miss julia was a hard woman with a dollar
 years ago when i asked her to put me in social security so's i wouldn't have to be working now miss julia threatened to fire me- all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her 5
 did you hear tim return? 14
    no sir
 nobody came until chief moore
 i drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil
 mrs buck have any men friends? 11
    her? 15
  the wrinkled mouth laughed revealing astonishingly strong white teeth
 but then i wasn't her social secretary
 was she on friendly terms with other members of her family? 12
  didn't have no family- around here
 they had a son- killed in the war
 i walked into the living room
 there didn't seem to be any signs of a struggle 14
 i told moore where does tim's wife live? 13
    i'll take you there
 look jed this is an open and shut case and i have to relie ve my men at the road block soon
 we did 80 miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks
 in late summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these
 now they were empty except for a cottage across the road 8
 mrs tim williams was about 21 with skin the color of bitter chocolate and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers she was startlingly pretty
 the inside of their place was full of new furniture five bucks down and a buck a week stuff but all of it clean and full of the warmth of a home
 mrs williams was both sullen and frightened
 she said she didn't know a thing- tim had left the house at six in the morning as usual
 she hadn't seen him since
 did mrs buck owe him any wages? 10
  i asked
 well for this week but they wasn't due 'till saturday 8
 listen mr inspector no matter what anybody say my tim didn't kill that woman! tim is a good man hard working
 he strong as a bull but gentle as a baby 10
 even if he angry tim wouldn't hurt a woman
 he never in his life took a hand to a woman or h   we'll get him soon see what he says chief moore cut in
 does your husband have a car? 8
  i asked
 got us an old station wagon
 need it for the job
 i asked a silly question: you've no idea where your husband could be now? 8
  she shook her head
 i knew she was lying
 i stood there staring at her for a moment- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty
 moore said come on jed i have to get to my men
 on my way out i told her if you should h eh h just happen to see your husband get him to give himself up
 he'll get a fair trial
 hiding out like this won't get him anything except more trouble or a bullet
 i'll tell him- if i see him
 we made it back to the harbor in less than four minutes 13
 i tried not to act scared
 that jaguar could really barrel along
 i told moore i was going to eat get some forms filled out by doc abel
 chief moore said if i don't see you when i return see you for certain at my road block inspector
 i had a bowl of decent chowder phoned the doc and he said he'd leave the death statements with his girl- in a half hour
 lighting my pipe i took a walk
 the harbor is a big yachting basin in the summer
 even now there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater
 there was a 34 foot wheeler with chief bob's in big gold letters on its stern also tied up at the dock
 it wasn't a new boat about five years old but fitted with fishing outriggers and chairs
 i asked an old guy running a fishing station if the boat was moore's
 bob moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing
 i dropped into the doctor's office picked up my forms 6
 as i was walking back to the police station which was in the same building with the city hall and post office i saw mrs tim williams sneaking into the back of my car
 if she moved gracefully she was clumsy at it 10
 i got into the front seat
 she was 'hiding' on the floor of the back seat the soft curves of her back and hips- rousing lines
 i drove out of the harbor turned off into a dirt road among the scrub pine trees and stopped
 i waited a few minutes and she sat up
 for another moment we didn't talk then she began to weep 9
 she mumbled i just know that chief moore is out to kill my tim! maybe
 i never saw him so anxious before i said lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette
 of course it could be because this is his first murder case 9
 you know where tim is don't you mrs williams? 14
    she puffed on the cigarette slowly sitting slumped against the back seat; didn't answer
 but the police have dropped the case
 i want you to go to pearson city and find out why- first-hand stuff for your modern crime series
 take the same train diana beauclerk took and get there at the same time
 go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite- 1105 9
 will the hotel rent it so soon after the crime? 11
    why not? 15
  the police have finished with it
 besides the number of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper
 to the hotel people you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that particular suite
 still they may not want to rent it
 once inside keep your eyes open! for what! alec was growing more and more skeptical
 the police will have gone over every square inch of the place with a fine-tooth comb
 the hotel people will have scoured and vacuumed it 11
 ten to one it's even been redecorated!   there's always a chance they may have overlooked something returned the chief
 i'm betting on that chance
 interview the bellboy and chambermaid who waited on beauclerk 6
 study the topography of the suite
 reenact everything beauclerk did
 try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself- between eleven pm and one am the night you arrive
 cheerful way to spend an evening! a sudden thought wiped the smirk from his face
 suppose the murderer should return to the scene of the crime!   the chief's eyes gleamed
 that is exactly what i'm hoping for
 after all the murderer is still at large
 and the key to the suite is still missing 14
 on the train alec refreshed his memory of the beauclerk case by reading teletype flimsies- spot-news stories about the crime sent out by the pearson city star a member of the syndicate press 9
 diana beauclerk was a second-rate actress living in new york 6
 two weeks ago she had gone west to pearson city 10
 daniel forbes her divorced husband lived there
 so did the firm of lawyers who had got her the divorce kimball and stacy
 she reached pearson city at nine pm and went straight to the hotel westmore
 she telephoned the junior partner of her law firm martin stacy and asked him to call at her hotel that evening
 at the time of her divorce forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum in lieu of further alimony if she remarried
 according to stacy she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask forbes for the lump sum
 stacy replied that it would bankrupt forbes who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture
 stacy said he left her suite at nine forty-five pm 8
 she was in good health and spirits but still determined to get the money from forbes
 no one saw stacy leave
 no other visitor inquired for her that evening 9
 next morning she was found dead in her suite with a bullet from a 
 22-caliber colt revolver in her brain
 according to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven pm and one am
 her door was locked and the key was missing
 when alec finished reading he was sure that either forbes or stacy had killed diana beauclerk
 forbes had motive and stacy had opportunity
 find a motive for stacy or an opportunity for forbes and the case would be solved
 the hotel westmore proved to be one of the older hotels in pearson city and definitely second-rate
 alec's first impression of the lobby was gloomy victorian dignity- black walnut and red plush a black and white tiled floor and persian rugs
 he studied the night clerk as a man measures an adversary 9
 i'd like the room i had the last time
 the clerk was young and limp with a tired smile
 do you recall the number? 18
    it was 1105
 that suite is taken
 alec's glance went to a chart of guest names and room numbers hanging on the wall behind the clerk
 opposite the number 1105 stood one word: unoccupied 9
 the clerk's glance followed alec's
 we have better rooms vacant now he babbled 12
 at the same rate
 alec's face was dark blunt and sulky
 he always looked impertinent and he could look dangerous 9
 he was looking dangerous now
 anything wrong with the plumbing in 1105? 7
    there was a sudden stillness in the lobby 23
 two women who had been chattering like parrots were struck dumb 7
 a man lighting a match for his cigar paused until the flame burned his fingers
 even the bellboys on their bench were listening
 of course not! anybody with a contagious disease been in there? 11
    no! the clerk was almost hysterical
 it's just that- well 1105 is being redecorated
 alec leaned on the desk holding the clerk's eyes with hi s 6
 suppose you tell me the real reason he drawled
 there might be a story in it
 st-story? 19
    i'm with the syndicated press feature service 4
 either i get the story- or i get the suite
 it was blackmail and the clerk knew it
 there is no story he piped tremulously
 front! show this gentleman to 1105!   the stillness persisted as alec followed a bellboy across the lobby to the elevator 5
 he could feel eyes on his back
 he wished it had not been necessary to announce the number of his suite quite so publicly
 the corridor on the eleventh floor was dimly lighted by electric globes at intervals of thirty feet
 a thick crimson carpet muffled every footfall
 at the end of the corridor alec noticed a door marked: fire stairs
 it was a neat setup for murder
 the bellboy unlocked a white door numbered 1105 11
 the room was dark but a neon sign flashed and faded beyond the window
 a few snowflakes sifted down through that theatrical red glow languid as falling feathers
 hastily the boy switched on a ceiling light
 the room looked normal and even commonplac e 12
 there was no hint of a violent struggle now 10
 deal furniture with a mahogany finish was neatly arranged as if it stood in the window of a department store
 the blue rug was suspiciously bright and new
 it had never been stained with blood
 table covers and towels were clean ashtrays empty and supplied with fresh matches
 the mirror over the bureau was a blank eye round and innocent 9
 alec played the part of an innocent tourist 10
 is there anything wrong with this room? 16
  n-no
 the boy dropped his eyes
 afraid you'll lose your job if you don't keep your mouth shut? 3
    the boy raised his eyes
 if you want my advice pack up and take the next train back to new york
 were you on duty here two weeks ago? 9
    the boy hesitated
 but i wouldn't spend a night in here for a million bucks!   he was in a hurry to get out of the room
 alec gave him a tip and let him go
 alone alec examined the doors
 there were three- one leading to a bathroom one to the hall and one to the room next door which was immovable- locked or bolted on the other side
 alec locked the hall door and put the key with his watch on the bedside table
 it was just quarter of nine
 as he ranged his belongings on the bureau he noticed a film of white dust on the dark surface of the wood beyond the linen cover 6
 not gray like the dust that collects in an unused room but white
 women didn't use white face powder nowadays he recalled 8
 they used pink tan or cream powder
 alec glanced into the bathroom
 blood in the bathtub where the murderer appears to have washed his hands
 it seemed clean now but alec decided against a bath 12
 he crawled into bed and switched off the light 9
 in the darkness he could see the rosy reflection of the neon sign on the wall opposite the window
 it winked as steadily as a metronome- on off- on off 9
 in less than five minutes alec was asleep 14
 he never knew just what woke him
 yet suddenly he was wide-awake
 there was no sound and apparently no movement in the room except the noiseless pulsation of the red light on the wall 8
 he lay still listening to the silence watching the light 10
 somewhere in the city a big clock sounded twelve solemn notes- midnight
 according to the medical examiner she was shot between eleven pm and one am h
 alec heard a faint sound
 his heart seemed to swell and knock against the wall of his chest 8
 for the sound was inside the room
 he let his eyelids droop and breathed heavily feigning sleep 10
 the sound was coming nearer
 a monstrous shadow fell across the illuminated wall distorted and indefinable
 when the neon sign faded out the shadow disappeared 9
 when the neon sign flashed on the shadow was still there 10
 it stretched to an impossible height climbing the wall to the ceiling
 that meant that something between the light and its reflection on the wall was moving closer to the source of the light- in this case the window
 cautiously alec tensed his muscles ready to jump
 the bedsprings betrayed him with a creak
 someone had moved beyond the range of the light from the window 7
 abandoning caution alec leaped out of bed and groped for the light switch
 before he could snap it on a stinging blow caught him in the ribs 9
 he lashed out blindly with his right
 there was a thick squashy crack of fist on flesh 14
 something hard grazed his knuckles
 he put everything he had into the next and aimed down where the stomach ought to be
 rough cloth rasped his fist
 there was a grunt curiously inarticulate like that of an animal in pain
 something heavy shook the floor as it dropped 10
 alec waited a moment on guard
 again he groped for the light switch
 the blue rug had been rolled up and stacked in one corner of the room
 on the bare floorboards a man lay face down 11
 he had a short heavy powerful body
 alec turned him over and discovered a round lumpy face with narrow slanting eyes- a primitive tartar face from russia or the balkans 6
 the man's shoes were too pointed his overcoat too broad at the shoulders and too narrow at the waist
 there was a slight bulge under the left armpit- a shoulder holster
 alec promptly removed the gun
 he was familiar with this type
 he had seen it in the lineup at police headquarters in new york in broadway night clubs and seventh avenue pool rooms in the criminal courts
 but he was surprised to meet it here
 diana beauclerk had no connection with the underworld 7
 a professional gunman would not have killed her with a weapon of such small caliber as a 
 nor would he choose a respectable hotel as the scene for a killing when it would be so much safer to take his victim for a one-way ride on a lonely country road
 he opened his eyes
 what are you doing here? 17
  demanded alec
 the man made no reply
 his lips were bruised and swollen where alec had hit him 8
 did you kill diana beauclerk? 11
  alec expected an indignant denial but there was no response at all
 oh come on snap out of it! or i'll turn you over to the police! the silence was getting on alec's nerves
 the man opened his mouth but no words came
 only that curious animal grunting alec had heard during their fight
 don't you speak english? 4
    the man opened his mouth wider
 a forefinger pointed toward his gullet
 alec leaned forward to look
 there were hideous scars inside the throat and the palate was mutilated
 in good time i shall get to the distressing actuality to red mciver and handley walker to murder and sudden death 6
 but you realize i am sure how much old deeds incite to new ones and you must forgive me if i tell you first of the old ones 8
 it was in 1814 that abraham wharf and his sister sat by a meager fire in their house on dogtown common a desolate place even then 7
 he was sharpening his razor
 sister said he do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven? 6
  and she answered i don't know but i hope you'll never do such a thing
 without a tremor god forbid! he said and went out and cut his throat in the cave near granny day's swamp
 what has this to do with the present? 14
  much i assure you
 you must know what gets into people even such as red and handley before you can tell what comes out of them
 they had learned both of them about abraham wharf 6
 that's why i beg you not to forget him
 his ghost is not laid
 red and handley god help them knew the old dogtown lore; and i knew they knew it for i'd told them a lot of it
 and isn't it true that you get a deeper perception about a man and his motives when you know what it is he knows? 7
    yes gentlemen i am getting to the point to my point 12
 you know the facts; they are set forth in your own newspapers 10
 you want from me the story but a story is about 'why' and then perhaps about 'how'
 the 'when' you know; yesterday morning
 so what i am trying to tell you is the 'why'- that is my point- and that concerns the spirit of the matter 10
 there is an inwardness and a luster to old furniture which has a provocative emanation if i may say so
 places too have their haunting qualities 10
 and my point in this sad story is the spirit of the matter 10
 when you hold the spirit of a thing then somehow you know the truth- you know a fake antique from the real thing
 and the truth is what you've come for is it not? 10
    now dogtown is one of those places that creeps into the marrow as worms get into old wood under the veneer
 in fact all the folk who lived on the back of cape ann they are not just like others
 there's a different hall-mark on them
 there were no witch burnings here because everyone had a witch in the family
 just think of old granther stannard who pulled the teeth of dark younger and because he bungled the job and left two protruding tusks she put such a hex on him that he thought his legs were made of glass
 after that he was never known to run or even walk fast 9
 today dogtown is the only deserted village in all new england that i know of
 there it sits a small highland with towns like gloucester near by; but now it's the most lost and tortured place in the world 6
 those who lived in that desolation of rocky deformity took on some of the moraine's stony character
 scientists say it is the last spewings of a great glacier but one rather feels that only a malevolent giant could have piled up those crouching monsters of granite which still seem to preserve a sort of suspended ominous life in them
 we'll walk up there later
 it's perhaps a mile from here where we sit
 and not one single dwelling left there though once in the early eighteenth century there were close to a hundred houses 9
 even i can remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumble d pillars and nobody has lived there in the memory of any living man 7
 it is now a sweep of boulders and ledges with oak walnut and sumac creeping across the common and everywhere the ruins and the long long shadows
 that's your setting and a sinister one
 please get that in your reports
 it accounts for so many things
 both red mciver and handley walker lived nearby almost as near as i do
 red lived at lanesville and from his house he could be up on the common in a half hour's brisk walk; handley lived further on at pigeon cove
 i'd often find one or other of them up around dogtown sketching 5
 they were both painters well anyhow dogtown common is so much off the beaten track nowadays that only sunday picnickers still stray up there from time to time
 sea-road railroad lack of water killed dogtown
 dead dead as a brass door nail and i sometimes feel like the sexton for i'm about the last to be even interested
 i knew red and handley well
 as i said they were both painters
 they'd come separately to gloucester some twenty years ago- there's always been an artists' colony somewhere on cape ann- and each married here
 they married cousins anta and freya norberg
 there are a lot of scandinavians in this neck of the woods and many still make painted furniture and take steam-baths 10
 pretty girls among them with blonde hair and pert faces 6
 handley married freya and red of the red beard married anta 9
 and it was because of an old norberg inheritance that i got to understand them all so well
 the quarrel ended in a ridiculous draw but i must tell you about it
 oh yes i'm quite sure it's important because of the beech pasture 7
 what's that? 10
  why that's what gave me the feeling gave me as- it-were the spirit the demoniac evil spirit of this whole affair 5
 you see besides being custodian of antiquities i am also registrar
 no i don't hold with those who live entirely among dead things
 i know as well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries where the live wind blows and not from the hull 7
 but you've got to know both
 what's below the water-line interests me also
 as i was saying i've known all about the old records including the old norberg deed
 some ten years ago that page was torn out i don't know by whom 0
 about five years ago handley came to ask me if he could see the tattered register
 he was courteous and casual about it as though it were of no consequence
 he's always like that in spite of being a big man 4
 of fingering i might almost say stroking a large mole with blac k hairs a sensual man but very courteous some would say slick 7
 like his glossy black hair
 too many outside manners to my taste
 he is the sort who with an appraising eye would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her 6
 a real gentleman i feel would do neither
 he's always worn a broad-brimmed hat and i've noticed in my small study at the society that he rather smells of cosmetics 4
 the next week cousin red wandered in as casually but curt and untidy
 red was small and fine-boned like ivory-inlay 9
 he too asked to see the same page
 when i told him someone had torn it out he shouted 7
 by god it's that damn handley the sneak! and later in the same week they both came together to examine the register
 fortunately we were alone in the building- so few people nowadays are interested even in their own past or in the lovely craft of other days- for they began to abuse each other in the foulest language
 red thrusting out his tawny beard handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair
 le rouge et le noir
 red always was morose yet that day the dapper handley was the louder of the two
 but for my presence they would have been at each others' throats 12
 during the quarrel i learned what the trouble was from the accusations each hurled at the other
 the beech pasture had suddenly become valuable 10
 there's a fine granite quarry there and granite's coming back for public buildings
 both men knew it was in the norberg family holdings but to which of the cousins did it belong anta or freya? 6
  fortunately i knew almost exactly what the will had said 9
 it began with a preamble of course
 this explained that the judge of probate of essex county 1785 or 1786 appointed three free-holders of gloucester to divide and establish the norberg estate
 after the usual honorable sirs it went on to say that there had been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased salu norberg one lower room on the western side privileges to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar also one cow right and lastly they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as dower namely the beech pasture 5
 and i remember that the whole of the privileges not counting the beech pasture was valued at twenty pounds
 i wish you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring coxcombs when i told them that obviously the pasture belonged to their wives jointly
 that battle scene ridiculous at it was remained in my mind 9
 a disturbing picture of bad blood to be further heightened with illicit if buccolic colors for on a subsequent day i saw handley escorting anta red's wife up on dogtown common
 i felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence 11
 not that i intentionally go unperceived but the boulders up there are very high and i am a small woman
 one other cause of jealousy between them i must tell you 9
 paint! gloomy and unkempt as red mciver was he was much the better painter
 i suppose handley knew it
 if red had a show at gloucester handley would hurry to hang his pictures in rockport
 you may say this has little pertinence but gentlemen remember that all this prepared my mind alerted my intelligence
 by such touches the pattern takes shape
 you would call these the motives of crime
 i would call them the patterns of life perhaps even the designs of destiny
 yet with all this knowledge i had nothing of substance to unravel our case as you would call it till yesterday
 one month ago on the 20th of october was the opening of the gunning season in massachusetts
 not much to shoot but there are a few pheasant 14
 rabbits too if you care for them which most of the folk around here haven't the sense to appreciate
 any more than they have the sense to eat mussels 12
 that was the day red was said to have gone away
 oh yes he'd talked about doing so
 in fact he often disappeared from time to time- off to paint the sea aboard a dragger out from gloucester
 anta his wife never seemed to mind
 i suppose these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with cousin handley
 anyhow i wasn't surprised early that morning to see handley himself crossing from dogtown common road to the back road 6
 no he didn't have his gun which he should have
 it would have been a good excuse for his being there at all 10
 i myself had been up there by seven o'clock after mushrooms since there'd been a week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear as sandwich glass
 that's what the man had said
 haney peered doubtfully at his drinking companion through bleary tear-filled eyes
 he had no ready answer as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing
 was the man drunk or crazy or both? 8
  but his new-found buddy had matched him drink for drink until he lost count and the man's eyes were still clear
 the guy is off his rocker haney thought to himself and looked away from those eyes
 eyes that were clear but also bright with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burning behind them
 why hadn't he noticed it before? 9
  no the man was not drunk h he wondered how he got tied up with this stranger
 but of course he remembered now
 it was blurred after two hours of steady drinking but the occasion of it came back to him
 the stranger his head seemingly sunk in thought started to cross the street against the light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection
 brakes howled and a horn blared furiously but the man would have been hit if phil hadn't called out to him a second before 6
 his shout had been involuntary something anybody might have done without thinking on the spur of the moment
 as a matter of fact he wouldn't have cared at all if the guy had been hit
 actually he regretted having opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them
 by then the stranger was thanking haney profusely and had one arm around his shoulders as if he were an old friend
 so the driver started to curse at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his safe-driving record 8
 then the man he saved turned and looked squarely into the truck driver's face without saying a word
 very suddenly the driver stopped swearing at them turned on his heel and went back to his truck
 haney hadn't given it much thought at the time
 now he recalled it very clearly and wondered what the truck driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off 6
 it must have been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word
 when the light went their way they went on across the street 8
 and when the stranger found out that phil was on the way to one of his favorite bars he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them
 phil usually went alone and kept to himself sitting in a corner and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges 5
 but he decided he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks even though he made good money at his job
 now he wondered if it was worth it having a screwball for company 6
 he really didn't take the offer seriously but he began to feel uneasy
 when he finally got the coughing under control he realized that pete was still waiting for an answer- he didn't even seem to wink as he continued to stare
 haney managed a weak laugh
 guess i can't think of anyone pete
 a faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows 10
 i think you aren't taking me seriously phil 14
 and everybody has some kind of grudge
 i might have got hit by that truck if it wasn't for you 7
 i believe in returning favors
 i'll do anything for somebody i like
 it won't cost you a cent phil
 go ahead and try me!   phil rubbed his forehead wearily 6
 he was beginning to feel woolly
 maybe it would be better to humor the guy and then make an exit 8
 he really didn't expect anything to come of it and there were a few people h   all right he conceded finally if you must know i don't get along with the landlord
 he keeps riding me because i like to listen to the radio and sing while i'm taking a bath
 he says the neighbors complain but i don't believe it 14
 why don't they tell me themselves if it bothers them? 8
    the man closed his eyes and nodded
 when he looked up again he seeemd almost contented 9
 it will take a little time
 i want to study your landlord's habits and movements first 10
 you see i always make it look like an accident 11
 maybe suicide if it looks reasonable
 in that way there's no trouble for the customer 14
 customer? 15
    pete smiled modestly
 it's my line of work he said h   five minutes later before haney could make his break the stranger stood up and nodded farewell 3
 haney watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure
 phil decided to stay a little longer and as time passed it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there but for the other glass on the table
 some time before midnight he returned to his apartment and hit the sack putting the whole incident out of mind before he fell asleep 7
 the next day sunday the hangover reminded haney where he had been the night before
 the hangover in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy and he groane d
 he went for more aspirin later in the day and passed the surly landlord on the way- he was still alive and scowling as usual as if tenants were a burden in his life
 phil shrugged and ignored him
 he went back to work monday
 by wednesday the landlord was still alive 11
 of course h on thursday haney mailed the monthly check for separate maintenance to his wife lolly and wished the stranger could do something about her h   coming home from work he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment building 6
 inside the lobby people were standing around talking excitedly 9
 his spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one of his fellow tenants what had happened
 late that afternoon it seemed he had fallen off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection
 he had apparently been alone
 nobody witnessed the fall- just the sickening impact when his body smashed on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance
 haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor as he felt the blood drain from his cheeks
 he muttered something about how terrible it was and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator
 once inside his apartment he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped limply in a chair
 after a while he began to feel better about it especially when no one bothered to ask any questions
 but after all why should they? 12
  still later he finally convinced himself that it was an accident- just a coincidence
 the stranger really had nothing to do with it of course h   haney went to bed happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord 6
 after all the man had no family so no one suffered and everybody was better off for it
 really he said to himself nobody kills a man just as a favor! so you thought i didn't mean what i said
 the stranger's eyes were large and sad as if phil haney had hurt his feelings
 it was like a recurrent annoying dream but now the dream was beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare
 however haney knew it was not a dream
 he might be very tight but he knew where he was 10
 it was the same bar and it was two weeks later- saturday night when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual
 he had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table as far as possible from any talkative friendly lushes
 he was enjoying the weekly ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened with water
 this favorite grievance was not the landlord 10
 he had already quite forgotten about him 13
 in fact he had only mentioned him on the spur of the moment 10
 his real grievance was lolly
 toward the end of his fourth hairy highball while he was moodily making wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass he became aware that he was not alone
 he looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld the stranger sitting across the table smiling a secret smile at him as if they were fellow conspirators
 he hadn't even noticed- what was his name? 9
  pete? 19
 - he hadn't seen him sit down
 the man was uncanny like a shadow and made as much noise as a shadow
 haney felt like shrinking out of sight but he was already trapped in the corner with the wiry dark little man
 he began to wish that he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through the crossing
 was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep for a bar-buddy? 7
  he'd have to start going to some of the other places again 10
 in a low voice almost whispering the man had asked phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off his back 8
 he made the mistake of answering in an offhand way and instantly realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice 8
 pete frowned slightly then became sad and moody
 haney didn't want to encourage his company but felt he ought to buy him a drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble 6
 but there was no trouble
 the guy sulked over his drink obviously upset by haney's lack of appreciation
 to break the uncomfortable silence haney began to talk 8
 in time and two drinks later he was complaining bitterly about his wife he was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he noticed the renewed interest in his listener- it showed in the alert face and the suddenly bright eyes
 when he paused to moisten his throat the stranger broke in 10
 but why pay her bills? 20
  if she runs around with other men and if you hate her as you say why not just divorce her? 7
    haney scowled
 that bitch would love a divorce he growled
 then she'd get half of everything i have
 community property deal- you know
 i'd have to sell out my business to pay her off with her share 5
 she can drop dead! pete nodded understandingly 11
 you must understand i haven't been in this state too long 10
 i came out here to retire
 that's why i- why i do a free job now and then
 you should have told me about her before
 haney felt a twinge of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again
 then a wild thought ran circles through his clouded brain 8
 suppose- just suppose this guy was really what he said he was! a retired professional killer h if he was just a nut no harm was done 7
 but if he was the real thing he could do something about lolly 12
 he felt very cunning very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot
 no offense intended he said gently
 but it's just that- well you know
 the cops didn't suspect a thing and i thought it was a coincidence
 after all i didn't know you pete
 it could have been an accident
 but if you say you managed it h the stranger was hooked 9
 yes yes he muttered impatiently
 of course it looked like an accident
 i always work it that way- and always at a time when the customer has an alibi
 let me prove it phil
 i think i can manage one more favor for you
 haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass 10
 about halfway back pops groped against a wall and stopped pulled away two loosely nailed wide boards at one end and went through 5
 c'mon he whispered; floor level's about three feet down so don't fall
 i went through and down into pitch darkness
 he said jist stay still
 i'll pull the boards back and then get us a light 4
 jist stay where you are
 i jist stayed where i was while he fumbled around and then walked away
 a moment later he struck a match and lighted a candle and i could see
 it was a big room empty except for a few things of pop's at the far end- a wooden crate on which stood the candle a spread out blanket and an unrolled bindle
 i looked back over my shoulder while i went to join him; he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no light would show through
 i took the pint bottle from my pocket and handed it over as i sat down beside him on the spread blanket
 he drank and handed it back
 nice place i told him
 listen i got a buddy i travel with real nice guy named larry 7
 i know where he is right near here
 could he join the party and sleep here tonight too? 8
  we'll both be blowing town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you
 he hesitated a second looking at the bottle before he said sure-sure and i reassured him
 he'll bring a bottle too and i'll get another one or maybe two while i'm out
 you can work on this one while i'm gone kill it if you want 10
 i took a short swallow from it myself and handed it to him 8
 his sure-sure was enthusiastic this time 12
 he put the bottle down
 git over by the window while there's light an' i'll put th' candle out
 when yuh come back i'll put it out agin till you're both inside 5
 charlie was waiting leaning against a building front 8
 perfect set-up i told him
 but we got to go back to fifth and get another bottle or two 11
 on the way i'll give you the scoop
 on the way i gave him the scoop
 i bought another pint of sherry and when we got back pops let us in in the dark put back the blanket and then lighted the candle again
 i introduced my friend larry to pops and we made ourselves comfortable
 there was still a little not much left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and killed it and charlie opened his 8
 i was reminded amusedly by a poem of kenneth patchen's called the murder of two men by a young kid wearing lemon colored gloves which patchen himself read on a record against jazz background 7
 the poem consisted of only two words the word wait repeated over and over at irregular intervals and with different inflections and then the word now! and a blaring final chord from the jazz group 5
 this was the same except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither of us was wearing gloves
 but we could wait all right; there was no hurry 11
 i said wait h wait to charlie and he grinned digging the reference
 we'd heard the record together once
 the second bottle passed a few times
 pop was taking long ones but not showing the effect yet 6
 he seemed as drunk as when i'd first talked to him but no drunker
 he had a capacity; if we'd really been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more wine
 about halfway through the second bottle charlie looked at me across pops who was sitting between us and asked now? 7
  i said wait and handed the bottle to pops for his final drink
 when he handed it back and i had hold of it safely pops was looking toward me and i said now to charlie and he swung the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket once 6
 it was a lead pipe cinch
 there was a sound like the one you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger only louder and pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise
 out cold if not dead; and he'd never known what hit him- he'd never known that anything had hit him
 i reached my hand towa rd him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat but charlie said wait!- and said it sharply not as in the patchen bit but as an order- so i stopped my hand and looked at him 6
 he was holding the piece of lead pipe out to m e 7
 we don't want to know whether he's dead yet
 i gauged that blow to be borderline
 to kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill
 you hit again about twice that hard before we know whether he's dead or not
 that way we'll never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice
 dig? 15
    i dug him i saw his point; it made sense 10
 i took the piece of pipe from charlie's hand and used it harder than he had
 the thunk was louder anyway and i thought i heard bone crack 9
 that did it if mine didn't
 and we'll never know which
 all right now i'll give you a hand
 we straightened pops up and i made sure there was no trace of a heartbeat
 let's put him down again the way he was
 it's a more natural position
 how do you feel? 17
  charlie asked me
 what do you feel? 25
    nothing
 well h maybe i'm exaggerating
 it was a kick but not a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again except for stakes
 but let's not talk about it abstractly until we're out of here 7
 now first question: the bottles
 shall we take them all with us or leave one? 6
    take them i said
 if we left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints 8
 here's the picture we want to leave for the fuzz- whenever the body gets found
 this happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum 9
 if they'd been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him
 and he'd have taken the weapon with him too so we take that 7
 i've been careful about fingerprints
 there are the boards over the window of course but they're not painted and too rough to take prints
 same goes for the rough cement of the ledge
 besides i doubt if the cops will even try dusting 7
 they find dead winos every day maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of death
 we can't take a chance on that
 we've got to assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the picture consistent
 our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have turned out his pockets
 we did that and found a dirty handkerchief some matches and fourteen cents in change
 we took the matches- they were book matches and once they'd been touched might retain fingerprints- and the change
 we discussed the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reas on to blow it out
 the candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't set fire to the crate when it guttered out
 a fire wouldn't have mattered except that it would cause pops to be found sooner
 he might not be found for days even weeks otherwise 6
 we went once more over every point then triple-checked 11
 being picked up for questioning by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining danger and we weren't picked up by a cop
 in fact nobody saw us cop or citizen
 winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was completely deserted at that hour
 which if it matters was one am
 less than three hours ago we'd decided in maxine wells's pad on cosmo to commit a trial murder
 it had gone like clockwork
 almost too smoothly i found myself thinking and then told myself that was ridiculous
 how safe is too safe? 13
  thinking like that can get you into a padded pad 6
 an hour later we were back in my unpadded pad killing what had been left of the second pint
 we decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow 7
 also our plans for me to commit charlie's murder and for him to commit mine
 but we were really going to do it
 we shook hands on it
 we planned ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes
 i'd tell him everything i'd learned about seaton's habits and habitat and he'd tell me the score on radic
 we made the date for two o'clock in the afternoon at maxine wells's pad
 charlie would get there early because he had the key 11
 from here on in the less charlie and i were seen together in public or visited one another's rooms the better
 i was dead tired and slept soundly as far as i know dreamlessly
 we met at maxine's and decided we were set to stay as long as it took into or even through the evening to talk things out 5
 charlie had brought food and we'd decided on no drinks 8
 i'd brought along the virgin pint from last night but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking
 i talked first telling him everything i knew about seaton and his house and domestic arrangements
 i drew diagrams and floor plans; he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces and flushed them down 6
 he gave me equivalent and even more detailed dope on radic including diagrams- one of the apartment building radic lived in and one of the apartment itself
 he'd been there several times back when while he and radic had been friends or at least not enemies
 it didn't take us as long as we'd thought it might; it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and charlie said well i guess that's it
 shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first? 6
  or would you rather deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin rummy or what? 7
    wait a minute charlie i said
 one thing we haven't discussed expense money 17
 we'll need some at least if only bus fare to the scene of the crime
 and if you're as flat broke as i am i think we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while the other does his dirty work
 all right i'll come clean
 i've got a little stashed for a rainy day and i guess this is rainy enough
 if you draw the short straw i'll lend you some bread like fifty bucks before i take off to visit my sister in frisco
 then after i'm back another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while i take care of your seat cover boy
 i took a deep breath and the plunge
 in that case let's not draw
 i'll go to bat first
 you'd have to wait till seaton's back from mexico city and also while i set it up with doris to have her have an alibi for d-night 6
 so it wouldn't be for days or even a week before you could do anything
 but your friend manny can go any time
 he grinned and clapped me on the shoulder
 i was hoping you'd say that willy
 but i wouldn't have suggested it
 well- in that case i take off tomorrow morning for frisco 7
 and in case i brought the money with me
 now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers merge without let
 self's integrity was and is and ever had been
 mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves the many threes-fulfilled on mars corporate and discorporate the precious few on earth- the unknown powers of three on earth that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself
 mike remained in trance; there was much to grok loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing- all that he had seen and heard and been at the archangel foster tabernacle h why bishop senator boone made him warily uneasy how miss dawn ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not the smell of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and wailing-   jubal's conversations coming and going- jubal's words troubled him most; he studied them compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling struggling to bridge between languages the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in
 the word church which turned up over and over again among jubal's words gave him knotty difficulty; there was no martian concept to match it- unless one took church and worship and god and congregation and many other words and equated them to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting h then forced the concept back into english in that phrase which had been rejected by jubal by mahmoud by digby
 he was closer to understanding it in english now although it could never have the inevitability of the martian concept it stood for 6
 in his mind he spoke simultaneously the english sentence and the martian word and felt closer grokking
 repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the lotus he sank into nirvana
 before midnight he speeded his heart resumed normal breathing ran down his check list uncurled and sat up
 he had been weary; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him 6
 he felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity for quiet
 he stepped out into the hall was delighted to encounter a water brother
 my you look chipper
 i feel fine! where is everybody? 12
  asleep
 ben and stinky went home an hour ago and people started going to bed
 mike felt disappointed that mahmoud had left; he wanted to explain his new grokking
 i ought to be asleep too but i felt like a snack
 are you hungry? 28
  sure i'm hungry!   come on there's some cold chicken and we'll see what else
 they went downstairs loaded a tray lavishly 15
 it's plenty warm
 a fine idea mike agreed
 warm enough to swim- real indian summer
 i'll switch on the floods
 i'll carry the tray
 he could see in almost total darkness
 jubal said that his night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown up and mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it; his foster parents had taught him to see 5
 as for the night being warm he would have been comfortable naked on mount everest but his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and pressure; he was considerate of their weakness once he learned of it
 but he was looking forward to snow- seeing for himself that each tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual as he had read- walking barefoot rolling in it
 in the meantime he was pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of his water brother
 i'll switch on the underwater lights
 that'll be plenty to eat by
 mike liked having light up through the ripples; it was a goodness beauty
 they picnicked by the pool then lay back on the grass and looked at stars
 it is mars isn't it? 27
  or antares? 21
    it is mars
 mike? 19
  what are they doing on mars? 7
    he hesitated; the question was too wide for the sparse english language
 on the side toward the horizon- the southern hemisphere- it is spring; plants are being taught to grow
 'taught to grow'? 13
  he hesitated
 larry teaches plants to grow
 but my people- martians i mean; i now grok you are my people- teach plants another way
 in the other hemisphere it is growing colder and nymphs those who stayed alive through the summer are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing
 of the humans we left at the equator one has discorporated and the others are sad
 yes i heard it in the news
 mike had not heard it; he had not known it until asked 6
 they should not be sad
 mr booker t w jones food technician first class is not sad; the old ones have cherished him
 he had his own face dark and beautiful
 oh dear! mike h do you ever get homesick? 7
  for mars? 26
    at first i was homesick he answered
 he rolled toward her and took her in his arms
 but now i am not lonely
 i grok i shall never be lonely again
 mike darling- they kissed and went on kissing
 presently his water brother said breathlessly 12
 oh my! that was almost worse than the first time 7
 you are all right my brother? 17
  yes
 a long time later by cosmic clock she said mike? 14
  is that- i mean 'do you know'-   i know
 it is for growing closer
 well h i've been ready a long time- goodness we all have but h never mind dear; turn just a little
 as they merged grokking together mike said softly and triumphantly: thou art god
 her answer was not in words
 then as their grokking made them ever closer and mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called him back: oh! h oh! thou art god!   we grok god
 on mars humans were building pressure domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship
 this went faster than scheduled as the martians were helpful 8
 part of the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of mars to make the planet more friendly to future human generations
 the old ones neither helped nor hindered this plan; time was not yet
 their meditations were approaching a violent cusp that would shape martian art for many millennia
 on earth elections continued and a very advanced poet published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation marks and spaces; time magazine reviewed it and suggested that the federation assembly daily record should be translated into the medium 6
 a colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs of plants and mrs joseph douglas was quoted as saying: i would no more sit down without flowers on my table than without serviettes
 a tibetan swami from palermo sicily announced in beverly hills a newly discovered ancient yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction between sexes 6
 his chelas were required to assume the matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud from rig-veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another room- nothing was stolen; the purpose was less immediate
 the president of the united states proclaimed the first sunday in november as national grandmothers' day and urged america to say it with flowers
 a funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting 8
 fosterite bishops after secret conclave announced the church's second major miracle: supreme bishop digby had been translated bodily to heaven and spot-promoted to archangel ranking with-but-after archangel foster
 the glorious news had been held up pending heavenly confirmation of the elevation of a new supreme bishop huey short- a candidate accepted by the boone faction after lots had been cast repeatedly
 l'unita and hoy published identical denunciations of short's elevation l'osservatore romano and the christian science monitor ignored it times of india snickered at it and the manchester guardian simply reported it- the fosterites in england were few but extremely militant
 digby was not pleased with his promotion
 the man from mars had interrupted him with his work half finished- and that stupid jackass short was certain to louse it up 6
 foster listened with angelic patience until digby ran down then said listen junior you're an angel now- so forget it
 eternity is no time for recriminations
 you too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me 8
 afterwards you did well enough
 now that short is supreme bishop he'll do all right he can't help it
 same as with the popes
 some of them were warts until they got promoted 14
 check with one of them go ahead- there's no professional jealousy here
 digby calmed down but made one request
 you can't touch him
 you shouldn't have tried to
 oh you can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of yourself
 but i'm telling you it'll be turned down- you don't understand the system yet
 the martians have their own setup different from ours and as long as they need him we can't touch him
 they run their show their way- the universe has variety something for everybody- a fact you field workers often miss 5
 you mean this punk can brush me aside and i've got to hold still for it? 7
    i held still for the same thing didn't i? 12
  i'm helping you now am i not? 9
  now look there's work to be done and lots of it 7
 the boss wants performance not gripes
 if you need a day off to calm down duck over to the muslim paradise and take it
 otherwise straighten your halo square your wings and dig in 9
 the sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel angelic 6
 get happy junior!   digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh 9
 where do i start? 13
    jubal did not hear of digby's disappearance when it was announced and when he did while he had a fleeting suspicion he dismissed it; if mike had had a finger in it he had gotten away with it- and what happened to supreme bishops worried jubal not at all as long as he wasn't bothered
 his household had gone through an upset
 jubal deduced what had happened but did not know with whom- and didn't want to inquire
 mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches
 anyhow it was high time the boy was salted
 jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved because patterns kept shifting- abc vs d then bcd vs a h or ab vs cd or ad vs cb through all ways that four women can gang up on each other
 this continued most of the week following that ill-starred trip to church during which period mike stayed in his room and usually in a trance so deep that jubal would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before
 jubal would not have minded it if service had not gone to pieces
 the girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing in to see if mike was all right and they were too preoccupied to cook much less be secretaries
 even rock-steady anne- hell anne was the worst! absent-minded subject to unexplained tears h jubal would have bet his life that if anne were to witness the second coming she would memorize date time personae events and barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes
 the expense and time involved are astronomical
 however we sent a third vessel out a much smaller and faster one than the first two
 we have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago; that is all i can tell you about them
 but the third ship came back several years ago and reported h   that it had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings! said hal forgetting in his enthusiasm that he had not been asked to speak
 macneff stopped pacing to stare at hal with his pale blue eyes 7
 how did you know? 19
  he said sharply
 forgive me sandalphon said hal
 but it was inevitable! did not the forerunner predict in his time and the world line that such a planet would be found? 11
  i believe it was on page 573!   macneff smiled and said i am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression 5
 how could they not? 20
  thought hal
 besides they were not the only impressions 13
 i still bear scars on my back where pornsen my gapt whipped me because i had not learned my lessons well enough
 he was a good impresser that pornsen
 was? 15
  is! as i grew older and was promoted so was he always where i was
 he was my gapt in the creche
 he was the dormitory gapt when i went to college and thought i was getting away from him
 he is now my block gapt
 he is the one responsible for my getting such low m r's 15
 swiftly came the revulsion the protest
 no not he for i and i alone am responsible for whatever happens to me
 if i get a low m r i do so because i want it that way or my dark self does
 if i die i die because i willed it so
 so forgive me sigmen for the contrary- to-reality thoughts!   please pardon me again sandalphon said hal
 but did the expedition find any records of the forerunner having been on this planet? 8
  perhaps even though this is too much to wish find the forerunner himself? 7
    no said macneff
 though that does not mean that there may not be such records there
 the expedition was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return to earth
 i can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what star this was though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere
 if you volunteer you will be told where you're going after the ship leaves
 and it leaves very soon
 you need a linguist? 13
  said hal
 the ship is huge said macneff but the number of military men and specialists we are taking limits the linguists to one
 we have considered several of your professionals because they were lamechians and above suspicion
 unfortunately h   hal waited: macneff paced some more frowning 8
 then he said unfortunately only one lamechian linguist exists and he is too old for this expedition
 therefore h a thousand pardons said hal
 but i have just thought of one thing
 no problem at all said macneff
 there will be no women aboard the gabriel
 and if a man is married he will automatically be given a divorce 9
 hal gasped and he said a divorce? 10
    macneff raised his hands apologetically and said you are horrified of course
 but from our reading of the western talmud we urielites believe that the forerunner knowing this situation would arise made reference to and provision for divorce
 it's inevitable in this case for the couple will be separated for at the least forty years
 naturally he couched the provision in obscure language 7
 in his great and glorious wisdom he knew that our enemies the israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned 8
 tell me more sandalphon
 six months later hal yarrow stood in the observation dome of the gabriel and watched the ball of earth dwindle above him 7
 it was night on this hemisphere but the light blazed from the megalopolises of australia japan china southeast asia india siberia 7
 hal the linguist saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken therein
 australia the philippine islands japan and northern china were inhabited by those members of the haijac union that spoke american 5
 southern china all of southeast asia southern india and ceylon these states of the malay federation spoke bazaar
 his mind turned the globe swiftly for him and he visualized africa which used swahili south of the sahara sea
 all around the mediterranean sea asia minor northern india and tibet hebrew was the native tongue
 in southern europe between the israeli republics and the icelandic-speaking peoples of northern europe was a thin but long stretch of territory called march
 this was no man's land disputed by the haijac union and the israeli republic a potential source of war for the last two hundred years
 neither nation would give up their claim on it yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second apocalyptic war 6
 so for all practical purposes it was an independent nation and by now had its own organized government 
 its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving tongues plus a new one called lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper
 hal saw in his mind the rest of earth: iceland greenland the caribbean islands and the eastern half of south america 6
 here the peoples spoke the tongue of iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the hawaiian-americans who were busy resettling north america and the western half of south america after the apocalyptic war
 then there was north america where american was the native speech of all except the twenty descendants of french-canadians living on the hudson bay preserve
 hal knew that when that side of earth rotated into the night zone sigmen city would blaze out into space
 and somewhere in that enormous light was his apartment 10
 but mary would soon no longer be living there for she would be notified in a few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to tahiti
 she would weep in private he was sure for she loved him in her frigid way though in public she would be dry-eyed
 her friends and professional associates would sympathize with her not because she had lost a beloved husband but because she had been married to a man who thought unrealistically
 if hal yarrow had been killed in a crash he must have wanted it that way
 there was no such thing as an accident
 somehow all the other passengers have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance had simultaneously agreed to die
 and therefore being in disgrace they would not be cremated and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony
 no the fish could eat their bodies for all the sturch cared 10
 hal felt sorry for mary; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome
 yet he told himself this was the best way
 he and mary would no longer have to tear and rend at each other; their mutual torture would be over
 mary was free to marry again not knowing that the sturch had secretly given her a divorce thinking that death had dissolved her marriage
 she would have a year in which to make up her mind to choose a mate from a list selected by her gapt
 perhaps the psychological barriers that had prevented her from conceiving hal's child would no longer be present
 hal doubted if this happy event would occur
 mary was as frozen below the navel as he
 no matter who the candidate for marriage selected by the gapt h   the gapt
 he would no longer have to see that fat face hear that whining voice h   hal yarrow! said the whining voice
 and slowly feeling himself icy yet burning hal turned 8
 there was the squat loose-jowled man smiling lopsidedly up at him
 my beloved ward my perennial gadfly said the whining voice 7
 i had no idea that you too would be on this glorious voyage 11
 but i might have known! we seem to be bound by love; sigmen himself must have foreseen it
 love to you my war d
 sigmen love you too my guardian said hal choking
 how wonderful to see your cherished self
 i had thought we would never again speak to each other 9
 the gabriel pointed towards her destination and under one-gee acceleration began to build up towards her ultimate velocity 99 7
 1 percent of the speed of light
 meanwhile all the personnel except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship went into the suspensor 7
 here they would lie in suspended animation for many years 9
 some time later after a check had been made of all automatic equipment the crew would join the others
 they would sleep while the gabriel's drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel could not have endured
 upon reaching the desired speed the automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end
 many years later the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration
 again a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure would be applied
 then after slowing the vessel considerably the drive would adjust to a one- gee deceleration
 and the crew would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation
 these members would then unthaw the rest of the personnel 10
 and in the half-year left before reaching their destination the men would carry out whatever preparations were needed 10
 hal yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out
 he had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo
 and from the first he faced a difficult task
 the expedition that had discovered ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand siddo words with an equal number of american words
 the description of the siddo syntax was very restricted 8
 and as hal found out obviously mistaken in many cases 12
 this discovery caused hal anxiety
 his duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen
 yet if he used all of the little means at his disposal he would be instructing his students wrongly
 moreover even getting this across would be difficult 10
 for one thing the organs of speech of the ozagen natives differed somewhat from earthmen's; the sounds made by these organs were therefore dissimilar
 it was true that they could be approximated but would the ozagenians understand these approximations? 13
    another obstacle was the grammatical construction of siddo
 instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached particle to indicate the past or future siddo used an entirely different word 8
 thus the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigalu'ahai meaning to live was in the perfect tense ksu'u'peli'afo and in the future mai'teipa
 the same use of an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses
 plus the fact that siddo not only had the normal three genders of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual
 fortunately gender was inflected though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in siddo
 the system of indicating gender varied according to tense 8
 all the other parts of speech: nouns pronouns adjectives adverbs and conjunctions operated under the same system as the verbs 7
 this was not for the angel just a matter of running through a logical or deductive chain or deciding on some action from some already established premise
 no doubt the angels could do that kind of thing as fast as any computer
 what gabriel was being asked to do now however was to re-examine all his basic assumptions make value-judgments on them and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives 5
 this is not wholly a reasoning process- a computer cannot do it all- and even in an angel it takes time
 perhaps especially in an angel whose assumptions had mostly been being reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however did not make it seem any less long to jack
 he had already become used to hesperus' snapping back answers to questions almost before jack could get them asked 8
 there was nothing he could do but wait
 at last gabriel spoke
 we misjudged you he said slowly
 we had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had time to develop a sense of justice
 of course we have before us the example of the great races at the galactic center; individually they are nearly as mortal as you- the difference does not seem very marked to us where it exists 5
 but they have survived for long periods as races whereas you are young
 we shall recommend to them that they shorten your trial period by half
 for now it is clear that we were in the wrong 12
 you may reclaim your property and the penalty on hesperus is lifted
 i did not perceive this essential distinction either first-born hesperus said at once i was only practicing a concept that jack taught me called a deal
 nevertheless you were its agent
 jack what is the nature of this concept? 13
    it's a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other jack said
 we regard it as fair only when each party feels that what he has received is as valuable or more valuable than what he has given 6
 his heart he discovered was pounding
 for instance hesperus agreed to help me find my property and i agreed to take him to earth
 between individuals this process is called bargaining 10
 when it is done between races or nations it is called making a treaty
 and the major part of my mission to your nest is to make a treaty between your race and mine
 recovering the property was much less important 9
 and apparently impossible
 though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give us
 hesperus and lucifer jack said show that we do
 another pause; but this one was not nearly as long 10
 then it is a matter of pleasure; of curiosity; of a more alive time
 yes those could be commodities under this concept 10
 but you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer are not long out of the nursery
 visiting the earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older
 this explained a great deal
 all the more reason then jack said why we must have a treaty 14
 we will gladly entertain your young and give them proper living quarters in return for their help in running our fusion reactors 6
 but we must know if this is in accordance with your customs and must have your agreement they will not misuse the power we put in their hands to our hurt
 but this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the dictates of their own natures and respect yours in turn 7
 to this we of course agree
 jack felt a wave of complete elation but in a second it had vanished without a trace
 what gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments and contract to let the angels serve on earth as it is in heaven regardless of the applicable earth laws 7
 the angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the earthmen- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature
 the simple treaty principle that gabriel was asking him to ratify in short was nothing less than total trust
 and it might be considering the uncomfortable custom the angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war
 furthermore even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be codified
 almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion not trust as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders 5
 yet there was some precedent for it
 the history of disarmament agreements for instance had been unreassuringly dismal; but the united states and the union of soviet socialist republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on this limited question
 out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the united nations; suspicion between member states still existed but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between arizona and california over water supplies
 besides agreements in principle with the petty details to be thrashed out later were commonplace in diplomatic history 5
 the trouble with them was that they almost never worked and in fact an agreement in principle historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither party really wanted the quarrel settled 8
 suppose that this one were to work? 9
  there was no question in jack's mind of the good faith on one side at least
 if mankind could be convinced of that h it was worth trying 7
 in fact it had to be tried
 it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth had ever signed
 secretary hart had taught jack at least partially to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters; but there was no small way to handle this one
 he turned back to the screens the crucial conclusive phrase on his lips
 but he was too late
 he had lost his audience
 for a moment he could make no sense at all of what he saw 13
 it seemed to be only a riot of color light and meaningless activity
 gradually he realized that the pentagon of angel elders had vanished and that the ritual learning dance of the nursery had been broken up
 the angels in the nursery were zigzagging wildly in all directions seemingly at random
 hesperus! what's going on here? 11
  what's happened? 8
    your brothers have been found
 they are on their way here
 where? 19
  i don't see them
 the instruments don't show them
 you can't see them yet jack
 they'll be in range in a short while
 jack scanned the skies the boards and the skies again 6
 no- there was a tiny pip on the radar; and it was getting bigger rapidly
 if that was the skiff it was making unprecedented speed
 then the skiff hove into sight just a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks of the coal sack 7
 through the telescope jack could see that both spacesuits were still attached to it
 the sail was still unfurled though there were a good many holes in it as langer had predicted would be the case by now 7
 it was a startling almost numenous sight; but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an enormous comet's-tail of angels 10
 the skiff was not heading for the nursery however 10
 it seemed unlikely that her crew if either of them were alive could even see the ariadne for they were passing her at a distance of nearly a light-year
 and there would be no chance of signaling them- without the nernst generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone
 fuming helpless he watched them pass him
 the sail ragged though it was still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power being poured out from the nursery stars 7
 he would never have believed without seeing it that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast
 but where was it going? 19
  and why was it causing so much agitation among the angels and being followed by so many of them? 7
  there was only one possible answer but jack's horrified mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff's course into the computer
 the curve on the card the computer spat back at him couldn't be argued with however
 the skiff was headed for the very center of the nebula- toward that place which jack knew now could hold nothing less important than the very core of the angel's life and religion
 it was clear that langer had at last found a way to attract the angel's attention
 it was equally clear that as of this moment the treaty was off 11
 langer would have to be headed off whether he knew where he was going or not
 almost surely he did; after all he had had the same set of facts as jack had had to work from and he was an almost frighteningly observant man
 but not having talked to the angels he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along the line
 had he decided perhaps that the center of the cloud was a center of government instead of a center of life and faith? 9
  but it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the holy of holies or was simply headed in that direction by accident 5
 if it was intentional it was now also unnecessary; and whether intentional or not the outcome would be disastrous
 jack crawled under the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from the nernst generator switch
 when he was back on his feet again and about to reinstall the fuses however he hesitated
 he h ad to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he had to have it fast
 but fusion power in the coal sack was what had triggered all the trouble in the first place- and he already had an angel aboard 8
 i'm going to turn my generator back on as i promised to do 5
 but i can't take you to earth yet
 first i've got to intercept my brothers before they get any deeper into trouble
 will you obstruct this or will you help? 11
  i know it's not part of the bargain and your elders might not like it
 nobody else can live in your hearth while i am in it hesperus said promptly
 as for my elders they have already admitted that they were wrong
 if because of this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permitted to go there at all
 therefore of course i will help
 with a short-lived sigh of relief jack plugged the fuses back in and threw the switch
 without an instant's transition the green light that meant full fusion power winked on the board
 always before it had taken five minutes to-   of course 8
 from here on out the ariadne was going to be hotter than any space cruiser man had ever dreamed of
 but since he had failed to anticipate it he lost the five minutes anyhow in plotting an intercept orbit
 hesperus don't use this t-tau vector trick of yours please 6
 ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow 7
 he rubbed his eyes sleepily with one huge paw
 ekstrohm nogol you guys okay? 11
    nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured nogol said 8
 he didn't say what would cure him; he had been explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself 6
 his small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face 6
 well let's take a ground-level look at the country around here
 the facsiport rolled open on the landscape
 a range of bluffs hugged the horizon the color of decaying moss
 above them the sky was the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above minneapolis seen against neon-lit snow 5
 that cold empty sky was full of fire and light 10
 it seemed almost a magnification of the galaxy itself of the milky way blown up by some master photographer
 this fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar system 8
 these planets were much bigger nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere
 but to the infuriation of scientists for no known reason not all of them did
 this would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids of yancy-6 in three generations
 they lay months away from the nearest earth star by jump drive and no one knew what they were good for although it was felt that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discovered- much like the continent of antarctica in ancient history 7
 how can a planet with so many neighbors be so lonely? 8
  ryan asked
 he was the captain so he could ask questions like that 10
 some can be lonely in a crowd nogol said elaborately 9
 what will we need outside ryan? 10
  ekstrohm asked
 no helmets the captain answered
 we can breathe out there all right
 it just won't be easy
 this old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago 9
 nitrogen and oxygen are about it
 ryan look over there nogol said
 think they're intelligent maybe hostile? 11
    i think they're dead ekstrohm interjected quietly 19
 i get no readings from them at all
 sonic electronic galvanic- all blank
 according to these needles they're stone dead 12
 ekstrohm you and i will have a look ryan said
 you hold down the fort nogol
 easy nogol confirmed
 i heard a story once about a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't get an encephalographic reading on him
 me i know the mind of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner
 i'm not worried about you mis-reading the dials nogol just about a lug like you reading them at all
 remember when the little hand is straight up that's negative 9
 positive results start when it goes towards the hand you use to make your mark
 ryan told him what he could do then
 ekstrohm smiled and followed the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall
 the strong negative field his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects
 actually the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal were not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred years adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories 5
 he wasn't likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever
 they ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance dropped to the ground
 it was day but in the thin atmosphere contrasts were sharp between light and shadow
 they walked from midnight to noon noon to midnight and came to the beast sprawled on its side
 ekstrohm nudged it with a boot
 hey this is pretty close to a wart-hog
 one of the best matches i've ever found 18
 well it has to happen
 still it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world
 it makes you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke and somebody has been everywhere before you even started 6
 the surveyor looked sidewise at the captain
 the big man seldom gave out with such thoughts
 what shall we do with this one? 13
  dissect it? 12
    ryan nudged it with his toe following ekstrohm's example 8
 it sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species to me
 no hands for one thing
 of course that's not definite proof
 no it isn't ekstrohm said
 i think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological setup around here
 in the meantime we might be thinking on the problem all these dead beasts represent
 what killed them? 16
  it looks like we did when we made blastdown
 but what about our landing was lethal to the creatures? 6
  radiation? 19
  ekstrohm suggested
 the planet is very low in radiation from mineral deposits and the atmosphere seems to shield out most of the solar output 8
 any little dose of radiation might knock off these critters 7
 i don't know about that
 maybe it would work the other way
 maybe because they have had virtually no radioactive exposure and don't have any r's stored up they could take a lot without harm 7
 then maybe it was the shockwave we set up
 or maybe it's sheer xenophobia
 they curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien- like a spaceship
 at this stage of the game anything could be possible 13
 but there's one possibility i particularly don't like 8
 and that is? 31
  suppose it was not us that killed these aliens 8
 suppose it is something right on the planet native to it 9
 i just hope it doesn't work on earthmen too
 these critters went real sudden
 ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought the camp is quiet 6
 the earthmen made camp outside the spaceship
 there was no reason to leave the comfortable quarters inside the ship except that faced with a possibility of sleeping on solid ground they simply had to get out
 the camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles ringed with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any being
 each man had a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforced intimacy on board the ship
 ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened to the sounds of the night on yancey-6 138
 there was a keening of wind and a cracking of the frozen ground 11
 insects there were on the world but they were frozen solid during the night only to revive and thaw in the morning sun
 the bunk he lay on was much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board
 yet he knew the others were sleeping more soundly now that they had renewed their contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high vacuum
 now there could be an end to pretending
 he threw off the light blanket and swung his feet off the bunk to the floor
 there was no longer any need to hide
 but what was there to do? 20
  what had changed for him? 13
    he no longer had to lie in his bunk all night his eyes closed pretending to sleep
 in privacy he could walk around leave the light on read 8
 it was small comfort for insomnia
 some doctors had informed him he was mistaken about this 7
 actually they said he did sleep but so shortly and fitfully that he forgot
 others admitted he was absolutely correct- he never slept 8
 his body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons
 occasionally he fell into a waking gritty-eyed stupor; but he never slept
 naturally he couldn't let his shipmates know this 9
 insomnia would ground him from the exploration service on physiological if not psychological grounds
 he had to hide it
 over the years he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide
 the buddies invariably took advantage of him 11
 since he couldn't sleep anyway he might as well stand their watches for them or write their reports
 where the hell did he get off threatening to report any laxness on their part to the captain? 8
  a man with insomnia had better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him
 ekstrohm had to hide his secret
 in a camp instead of shipboard hiding the secret was easier 9
 but the secret itself was just as hard
 ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the ship's library a book by bloch the famous twentieth century expert on sex 5
 he scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated nineteenth century sex murderer but he couldn't seem to concentrate on the weighty pontifical ponderous style
 on impulse he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the hatch of the bubble
 ekstrohm walked through the alien glass and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations smelling the frozen sterility of the thin air 7
 behind him his mates stirred without waking
 ekstrohm was startled in the morning by a banging on the hatch of his bubble
 it took him a few seconds to put his thoughts in order and then he got up from the bunk where he had been resting sleeplessly 7
 the angry burnt-red face of ryan greeted him 11
 okay stormy this isn't the place for fun and games 6
 what did you do with them? 15
    do with what? 17
  the dead beasties
 all the dead animals laying around the ship
 what are you talking about ryan? 19
  what do you think i did with them? 17
    i don't know
 all i know is that they are gone
 gone? 19
    ekstrohm shouldered his way outside and scanned the veldt 6
 there was no ring of animal corpses
 nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen breeze 7
 i'll be damned ekstrohm said
 you are right now buddy
 expe doesn't like anybody mucking up primary evidence 9
 where do you get off ryan? 10
  ekstrohm demanded
 why pick me for your patsy? 9
  this has got to be some kind of local phenomenon 13
 why accuse a shipmate of being behind this? 8
  listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of every doubt
 but you aren't exactly the model of a surveyor you know 8
 you've been riding on a pink ticket for six years you know that 6
 no ekstrohm said no i didn't know that
 you've been hiding things from me and nogol every jump we've made with you
 now comes this! it fits the pattern of secrecy and stealth you've been involved in
 what could i do with your lousy dead bodies? 11
  what would i want with them? 11
  all i know is that you were outside the bubbles last night and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm web
 now all the bodies are missing like they got up and walked away
 it was not a new experience to ekstrohm
 suspicion wasn't new to him at all
 ryan there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies
 look for them will you? 9
  i give you my word i'm not trying to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition
 take my word can't you? 10
    ryan shook his head
 i don't think i can
 there's still such a thing as mental illness
 you may not be responsible
 don't try anything violent stormy
 i outweigh you fifty pounds and i'm fast for a big man 7
 i wasn't planning on jumping you
 why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong? 11
  she lived and was given a name
 for her first three vegetable months she waved her crabbed claws kicked weakly with her clubbed feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant
 she was not alone for there were three other such children in the big city's special nursery
 soon they all were removed to central laboratory school where their delicate transformation began
 one of the babies died in the initial transferral but of helva's class seventeen thrived in the metal shells 10
 instead of kicking feet helva's neural responses started her wheels; instead of grabbing with hands she manipulated mechanical extensions
 as she matured more and more neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went into the maintenance and running of a space ship
 for helva was destined to be the brain half of a scout ship partnered with a man or a woman whichever she chose as the mobile half 5
 she would be among the elite of her kind
 her initial intelligence tests registered above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high
 as long as her development within her shell lived up to expectations and there were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering helva would live a rewarding rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have faced as an ordinary normal being
 however no diagram of her brain patterns no early iq tests recorded certain essential facts about helva that central must eventually learn
 they would have to bide their official time and see trusting that the massive doses of shell-psychology would suffice her too as the necessary bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession
 a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resources central had to build into their scout ships
 brain ships were of course long past the experimental stages 8
 most babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept their bodies small eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller to larger shells
 and very very few were lost when the final connection was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine
 shell people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities were but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places with the most perfect body in the universe 5
 so for happy years helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates playing such games as stall power-seek studying her lessons in trajectory propulsion techniques computation logistics mental hygiene basic alien psychology philology space history law traffic codes: all the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning logical informed citizen
 not so obvious to her but of more importance to her teachers helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid
 she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction
 helva's civilization was not without busy do-good associations exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial citizens
 one such group got all incensed over shelled children when helva was just turning fourteen
 when they were forced to central worlds shrugged its shoulders arranged a tour of the laboratory schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the members case histories complete with photographs 6
 very few committees ever looked past the first few photos 12
 most of their original objections about shells were overridden by the relief that these hideous bodies were mercifully concealed 7
 helva's class was doing fine arts a selective subject in her crowded program
 she had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel 6
 her subject was large- a copy of the last supper- and her canvas small- the head of a tiny screw
 she had tuned her sight to the proper degree
 as she worked she absentmindedly crooned producing a curious sound
 shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound issued through microphones rather than mouths
 helva's hum then had a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic wanderings
 why what a lovely voice you have said one of the female visitors 8
 helva looked up and caught a fascinating panorama of regular dirty craters on a flaky pink surface
 her hum became a gurgle of surprise
 she instinctively regulated her sight until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores assumed normal proportions
 yes we have quite a few years of voice training madam remarked helva calmly
 vocal peculiarities often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar distances and must be eliminated 8
 although this was the first time that helva had seen unshelled people she took this experience calmly
 any other reaction would have been reported instantly 10
 i meant that you have a nice singing voice h dear the lady amended
 would you like to see my work? 12
  helva asked politely
 she instinctively sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away for further meditation
 i am currently reproducing the last supper on the head of a screw 11
 o i say the lady twittered
 helva turned her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically
 of course some of my color values do not match the old master's and the perspective is faulty but i believe it to be a fair copy 11
 the lady's eyes unmagnified bugged out
 oh i forget and helva's voice was really contrite 9
 if she could have blushed she would have 10
 you people don't have adjustable vision
 the monitor of this discourse grinned with pride and amusement as helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate
 here this will help suggested helva substituting a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture
 in a kind of shock the ladies and gentlemen of the committee bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed last supper on the head of a screw
 well remarked one gentleman who had been forced to accompany his wife the good lord can eat where angels fear to tread 7
 are you referring sir asked helva politely to the dark age discussions of the number of angels who could stand on the head of a pin? 7
    i had that in mind
 if you substitute 'atom' for 'angel' the problem is not insoluble given the metallic content of the pin in question
 which you are programed to compute? 11
  of course
 did they remember to program a sense of humor as well young lady? 8
    we are directed to develop a sense of proportion sir which contributes the same effect
 the good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip was worth his time
 if the investigation committee spent months digesting the thoughtful food served them at the laboratory school they left helva with a morsel as well
 singing as applicable to herself required research 9
 she had of course been exposed to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the better known classical works such as tristan und isolde candide oklahoma nozze de figaro the atomic age singers eileen farrell elvis presley and geraldine todd as well as the curious rhythmic progressions of the venusians capellan visual chromatics and the sonic concerti of the altairians 4
 but singing for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties to be overcome
 shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before making a prognosis
 balanced properly between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people led them to extricate themselves their ships and personnel from bizarre situations 7
 therefore to helva the problem that she couldn't open her mouth to sing among other restrictions did not bother her 5
 she would work out a method by-passing her limitations whereby she could sing
 she approached the problem by investigating the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries human and instrumental 6
 her own sound production equipment was essentially more instrumental than vocal
 breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most development and practice 5
 shell people did not strictly speaking breathe
 for their purposes oxygen and other gases were not drawn from the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained artificially by solution in their shells
 after experimentation helva discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain tone
 by relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses she could direct the vowel sounds into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone
 she compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them not at all unharmonious merely unique 7
 acquiring a repertoire from the laboratory library was no problem to one trained to perfect recall
 she found herself able to sing any role and any song which struck her fancy
 it would not have occurred to her that it was curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo soprano and coloratura as she pleased
 it was to helva only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the music attempted 10
 if the authorities remarked on her curious avocation they did so among themselves
 shell people were encouraged to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical work
 on the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her shell helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship the xh-834 6
 her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship 7
 the neural audio visual and sensory connections were made and sealed
 her extendibles were diverted connected or augmented and the final delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while helva remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings 6
 when she awoke she was the ship
 her brain and intelligence controlled every function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class needed 6
 she could take care of herself and her ambulatory half in any situation already recorded in the annals of central worlds and any situation its most fertile minds could imagine
 her first actual flight for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels since she was eight showed her complete mastery of the techniques of her profession
 she was ready for her great adventures and the arrival of her mobile partner
 there were nine qualified scouts sitting around collecting base pay the day helva was commissioned
 there were several missions which demanded instant attention but helva had been of interest to several department heads in central for some time and each man was determined to have her assigned to his section
 consequently no one had remembered to introduce helva to the prospective partners
 the ship always chose its own partner
 had there been another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would have been guided to make the first move
 as it was while central wrangled among itself robert tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks out to the field and over to helva's slim metal hull
 hello anyone at home? 11
  tanner wisecracked
 of course replied helva logically activating her outside scanners 11
 are you my partner? 11
  she asked hopefully as she recognized the scout service uniform 12
 all you have to do is ask he retorted hopefully 16
 i thought perhaps there were no partners available and i've had no directives from central
 even to herself helva sounded a little self-pitying but the truth was she was lonely sitting on the darkened field
 always she had had the company of other shells and more recently technicians by the score
 the sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and become oppressive
 no directives from central is scarcely a cause for regret but there happen to be eight other guys biting their fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you you beautiful thing 6
 it would have killed you in the cabin
 do you have anything for me? 21
  mercer stammered not knowing what b'dikkat meant and the two-nosed man answered for him i think he has a nice baby head but it isn't big enough for you to take yet
 mercer never noticed the needle touch his arm
 b'dikkat had turned to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit mercer
 he tried to run after b'dikkat to hug the lead spacesuit to tell b'dikkat that he loved him
 he stumbled and fell but it did not hurt
 the many-bodied girl lay near him
 isn't it wonderful? 5
  you're beautiful beautiful beautiful
 i'm so happy to be here
 the woman covered with growing hands came and sat beside them 9
 she radiated warmth and good fellowship
 mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming 8
 he struggled out of his clothes
 it was foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people did
 the two women babbled and crooned at him
 with one corner of his mind he knew that they were saying nothing just expressing the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it
 with most of his mind he was happy
 he wondered how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet as nice as this
 he tried to tell the la dy da but the words weren't quite straight
 a painful stab hit him in the abdomen
 the drug went after the pain and swallowed it
 it was like the cap in the hospital only a thousand times better 12
 the pain was gone though it had been crippling the first time 7
 he forced himself to be deliberate
 he rammed his mind into focus and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert that was a good bite 6
 maybe i will grow another head
 that would make b'dikkat happy!   the lady da forced the foremost of her bodies in an upright position
 said she i'm strong too
 remember man remember
 we can die too we can die like real people
 i do so believe in death!   mercer smiled at her through his happiness
 but isn't this nice h   with this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack
 he was wide awake but he did not feel like doing anything 9
 in that beautiful place among all those companionable and attractive people he sat and smiled
 b'dikkat was sterilizing his knives
 mercer wondered how long the super-condamine had lasted him 8
 he endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement
 the agonies of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him but meant nothing
 he watched his own body with remote casual interest 9
 the lady da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him 9
 after a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his powerful arms
 having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at them and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged 7
 mercer saw the sun rise on occasion closed his eyes briefly and opened them to see stars shining
 the dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way; the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body
 at last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain 10
 the pains themselves had not changed; he had 10
 he knew all the events which could take place on shayol 8
 he remembered them well from his happy period
 formerly he had noticed them- now he felt them 6
 he tried to ask the lady da how long they had had the drug and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again 8
 she smiled at him with benign remote happiness; apparently her many torsos stretched out along the ground had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body
 she meant him well but was in no condition for articulate speech 9
 the half-man lay on the ground arteries pulsating prettily behind the half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity 6
 mercer squeezed the man's shoulder
 the half-man woke recognized mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin
 'a good morrow to you my boy'
 that's out of a play
 did you ever see a play? 14
    you mean a game with cards? 11
    no said the half-man a sort of eye-machine with real people doing the figures
 i never saw that said mercer but i-   but you want to ask me when b'dikkat is going to come back with the needle
 yes said mercer a little ashamed of his obviousness 10
 that's why i think of plays
 we all know what is going to happen
 we all know when it is going to happen
 we all know what the dummies will do- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated men were cradled- and we all know what the new people will ask
 but we never know how long a scene is going to take 10
 what's a 'scene'? 15
  asked mercer
 is that the name for the needle? 17
    the half-man laughed with something close to real humor 8
 you've got the lovelies on the brain
 a scene is just a part of a play
 i mean we know the order in which things happen but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days or to make calendars and there's not much climate here so none of us know how long anything takes
 the pain seems short and the pleasure seems long
 i'm inclined to think that they are about two earth-weeks each 7
 mercer did not know what an earth-week was since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction but he got nothing more from the half-man at that time
 the half-man received a dromozootic implant turned red in the face shouted senselessly at mercer take it out you fool! take it out of me! when mercer looked on helplessly the half-man twisted over on his side his pink dusty back turned to mercer and wept hoarsely and quietly to himself
 mercer himself could not tell how long it was before b'dikkat came back
 it might have been several days
 it might have been several months
 once again b'dikkat moved among them like a father; once again they clustered like children
 this time b'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had grown out of mercer's thigh- a sleeping child's head covered with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes 5
 mercer got the blissful needle
 when b'dikkat cut the head from mercer's thigh he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body 5
 he saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut; he felt the far cool flash of unimportant pain as b'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which stopped all bleeding immediately 7
 the next time it was two legs growing from his chest 9
 then there had been another head beside his own 17
 or was that after the torso and legs waist to toe-tips of the little girl which had grown from his side? 5
    he forgot the order
 he did not count time
 lady da smiled at him often but there was no love in this place 9
 she had lost the extra torsos
 in between teratologies she was a pretty and shapely woman; but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper to him repeated some thousands of time repeated with smiles and hope people never live forever
 she found this immensely comforting even though mercer did not make much sense out of it
 thus events occurred and victims changed in appearance and new ones arrived
 sometimes b'dikkat took the new ones resting in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains in a ground-truck to be added to other herds
 the bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them
 finally mercer did manage to follow b'dikkat to the door of the cabin
 he had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it 9
 only the memory of previous hurt bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if he did not ask b'dikkat when he mercer was happy the answer would no longer be available when he needed it 5
 fighting pleasure itself he begged b'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long he had been there
 b'dikkat grudgingly agreed but he did not come out of the doorway
 he spoke through the public address box built into the cabin and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend b'dikkat might be wanting to tell them 6
 when he said it they thought it exceedingly profound though none of them understood it since it was simply the amount of time that mercer had been on shayol:   standard years- eighty-four years seven months three days two hours eleven and one half minutes
 mercer turned away
 the secret little corner of his mind which stayed sane through happiness and pain made him wonder about b'dikkat
 what persuaded the cow-man to remain on shayol? 12
  what kept him happy without super-condamine? 10
  was b'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day surrounded by a family of little cow-people resembling himself? 6
  mercer despite his happiness wept a little at the strange fate of b'dikkat
 his own fate he accepted
 he remembered the last time he had eaten- actual eggs from a n actual pan
 the dromozoa kept him alive but he did not know how they did it
 he staggered back to the group
 the lady da naked in the dusty plain waved a hospitable hand and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her
 there were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them but he appreciated the kindliness of her gesture none the less 5
 the years if they were years went by
 the land of shayol did not change
 sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men; those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of captain alvarez
 there was night and day but no setting of crops no change of season no generations of men
 time stood still for these people and their load of pleasure was so commingled with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the lady da took on very remote meaning
 her statement was a hope not a truth in which they could believe
 they did not have the wit to follow the stars in their courses to exchange names with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all
 there was no dream of escape for these people 15
 though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from the field beyond b'dikkat's cabin they did not make plans to hide among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh
 far long ago some other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter
 his handwriting was on a rock
 mercer read it and so had a few of the others but they could not tell which man had done it
 the letter scraped on stone had been a message home 11
 they could still read the opening: once i was like you stepping out of my window at the end of day and letting the winds blow me gently toward the place i lived in
 once like you i had one head two hands ten fingers on my hands 8
 the front part of my head was called a face and i could talk with it
 now i can only write and that only when i get out of pain 10
 dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner 6
 he was well rid of her
 he certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle as ann 8
 if he had married her he'd have been asking for trouble 13
 but all of this was rationalization
 sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of ann and then could not get back to sleep
 his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing
 the easiest thing would be to sell out to al budd and leave the country but there was a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it 6
 the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work
 he found that if he was tired enough at night he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake
 each day he found himself thinking less often of ann; each day the hurt was a little duller a little less poignant
 he had plenty of work to do
 because the summer was unusually dry and hot the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years
 the grass in the meadows came fast now that the warm weather was here
 he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows 6
 he had no idea how much time budd would give him 13
 in any case he had no intention of being caught asleep so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence
 he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon but nothing happened each day dragging out with monotonous calm
 when in late afternoon on the last day in june he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle
 it could be some kind of trick budd had thought up 17
 no one walked in this country least of all ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew
 morgan watched the two figures for a time puzzled 9
 when they were closer and he saw that one was a woman he was more puzzled than ever
 he cleaned his shovel left it against the fence picked up his winchester and started downstream
 his visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow angling toward the house
 now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly staggering as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet
 reaching the house ahead of them he waited with his winchester in his hands
 they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him and now he saw that both were young not more than nineteen or twenty 7
 they were dirty their clothes were torn and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door
 she lay there making no effort to get back on her feet 10
 the boy came on to the porch and sat down his gaze on morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring
 morgan hesitated thinking that if this was a trick it was a good one
 he didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending 6
 the boy licked his dry lips
 he asked could we have a drink? 13
  morgan jerked his head toward the front door 8
 in the kitchen he said
 leaning his winchester against the front of the house he walked to the girl
 there's water in the house
 she didn't move or say anything
 her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him 6
 she had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked
 her face was very thin and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling the new skin under it red and angry 5
 her blond hair was frowzy her dress torn in several places and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection
 it must have hurt her even to walk for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding 7
 he picked her up sliding one hand under her shoulders the other under her knees and carried her into the house
 she was amazingly light and so relaxed in his arms that he wasn't even sure she was conscious
 any lingering suspicion that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled
 no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him 6
 besides she had a sweet face that attracted him 9
 he put her down on the couch and going into the kitchen saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table 6
 they looked a good deal alike morgan thought 14
 both had blonde hair and blue eyes and there was even a faint similarity of features
 morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf went back into the front room lifted the girl's head and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth
 she drank greedily and murmured thank you as he lowered her head
 he stood looking down at her for a moment wondering what could have reduced her to this condition
 he had seen a few nester wagons go through the country the families almost starving to death but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two
 the girl dropped off to sleep
 morgan returned to the kitchen built a fire and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove
 he brought his winchester in from the front of the house then faced the boy
 who are you and what happened to you? 11
  he asked
 i'm billy jones the boy answered
 we ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days 9
 what are you doing here? 17
    are we in wyoming? 22
  morgan nodded
 about five miles north of the line
 jones sighed as if relieved
 we've been looking for work but all the ranchers have turned us down
 you mean you dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work? 7
  morgan demanded
 the town of buckhorn's only about six miles from here 8
 why didn't you go there? 13
    we didn't want town work jones said
 this is a mighty empty country morgan said
 there's only one more ranch three miles north of here 4
 you'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places 7
 then we're lucky we got here
 could you give us a job mr h   morgan
 he was silent a moment thinking he could use a man this time of year and if the girl could cook it would give him more time in the meadows but he knew nothing about the couple
 they might kill him in his sleep thinking there was money in the house
 he dismissed the possibility at once
 the girl's thin face haunted him
 it wasn't the face of a killer
 he wasn't so sure about the boy
 he hadn't shaved for several weeks his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic woebegone expression
 there was more to this than jones had told him 14
 they were running from something
 he'd be an idiot to let them stay he thought but he couldn't send them on either
 i could use some help morgan said finally but i can't afford to pay you anything
 i guess you'd better go on in the morning
 we'll work for our keep the boy said eagerly
 i've been mucking in a mine in the san juan but i used to work on a ranch
 sharon she's cooked in a restaurant
 we'll work hard mr morgan
 right now you need a meal and a bath
 your wife's in terrible shape
 i know jones said dejectedly
 morgan filled the fire box with wood again then started supper and set the table
 when the meal was ready he told jones to wash up and going into the front room woke the girl
 he said i've got some supper ready
 she rubbed her eyes and stretched then sat up her hands going to her hair
 i'm a mess she said and suddenly she was alarmed
 who are you? 12
  how did we get here? 16
    i'm dan morgan
 this is the rafter m
 you fell down in front of the house and i carried you in 10
 i gave you a drink and then you went to sleep
 she stared at him her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said; then she murmured: you're very kind mr morgan
 do you take in all the strays who come by? 13
  i don't have many strays coming to my front door he said 5
 think you can walk to the table? 12
    of course
 she got to her feet staggered and almost fell 10
 he caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen 7
 she sat down at the table shaking her head 13
 i'm usually a very strong woman but i'm awfully tired 3
 it's not much of a meal but it's what i eat
 not much of a meal? 12
  the girl cried
 mr morgan it's the best-looking food i ever saw 6
 he told himself he had never seen two people eat so much 9
 when they were finally satisfied jones said i think he's going to give us work
 the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed of himself 9
 when he saw the expression in her eyes he knew he couldn't send them on
 she said i guess the lord looks out for fools drunkards and innocents
 which are you? 16
    we're not drunkards she said
 that's all i'm sure of
 she helped him with the dishes then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark
 he carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall
 he said: you'll feel a lot better after you have a bath 10
 your feet are in bad shape mrs jones
 you'll have to go to town to see the doc
 no she'll be all right jones said quickly
 i mean we don't have any way to get there and we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town
 could you find me a needle and thread? 8
  the girl asked
 my dress needs some work on it
 he nodded and going into the bedroom brought a needle thread and scissors
 he said: i'm going to bed
 he nodded at the door in front of him
 the bed isn't made but you'll find plenty of blankets there 7
 you're awfully kind the girl said
 we'll pay you back if you'll let us
 it's all right he said
 you'd better sleep
 jones followed him into the front room closing the door behind him
 he said: if it's all right with you mr morgan i'll sleep out here on the couch
 we haven't slept together since we started
 i just can't take any chances on getting her pregnant and if we were sleeping together h   he stopped embarrassed and morgan said i understand that but i don't savvy why you'd go off and leave your jobs in the first place
 we got fired jones said
 we had to do something
 they were a pair of lost whipped kids morgan thought as he went to bed
 you can't stay here with me
 it's late and you said they'd be here by dawn
 you can't make me go
 gavin sank down again into his chair and began to rock 7
 he was thinking of rittenhouse and how he had left him there to rock to death on the porch of the splendide
 it was the only thing in his life for which he felt guilt 17
 beneath his black shirt his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat the stored pain shattering free in slow gasps terrible to see
 clayton tried to call back the face of the man he had known 12
 against that other man he could rally his anger; against this bent man in the chair he was powerless
 gavin's lips moved so that clayton had to stoop to catch the words
 do you remember big charlie? 15
  he whispered
 he stuck with me all these years
 just a half-breed 'pache never said much never meant anythin to me but he stuck with me
 he got into a fight with tom english your brother's son 8
 it was a fair fight the boy provoked it- big charlie told me so 12
 they killed big charlie dumped his body in my rose garden two nights ago
 my men they all left me
 i didn't understand why clay
 they just all cleared out
 i treated them fair h he wiped his lips with a sleeve then stared at clayton in a childish kind of wonder
 do you mean- he asked almost shyly- you want me to go with you wherever you're goin? 11
    yes
 you don't hate me any more? 8
  clayton choked shook his head murmuring no
 the old man beckoned with one finger and clayton went forward to him
 gavin slipped his arms around his chest and hugged him fiercely 6
 all my life he said i tried
 i saw you driftin away- but i tried
 and you wanted no part of me when i had so much to give 11
 now there's nothin left of me
 laurel is gone my men are gone ed is dead- and you come to me to help me
 oh! god in heaven i can't refuse you now
 that would mock me too much! can't let you go way from me again h he closed his eyes ashamed of his tears
 clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back 6
 the eyes followed him fearfully
 i'll saddle the horses and bring them round
 he burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold night air
 gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches over the saddle blanket working by touch in the darkness comforting the animal with easy words
 when he had finished he led him and the mare to the porch 13
 the stallion had smelled the mare coming into heat and began to paw the turf shaking his head
 clayton looped the reins in a knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his neck
 the mare had backed away
 you take it easy boy clayton whispered
 she doesn't want you now
 you take it easy your time will come
 gavin stood on the porch a thin figure
 he had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand the stock bumping on the wood floor
 clayton called to him and he came slowly down the steps 8
 clay he said where are we goin? 10
    to a ranch in the valley
 there's someone there i have to see
 we may take her with us- to california
 i don't know yet it's crazy; i have to think about it 11
 but california is where we're goin
 that's a new land
 a man could make a mark there
 two men together like us we could do somethin fine out there maybe find a place where no one's ever been
 start out fresh the two of us like nothin had ever happened 7
 yes like a father and son
 i made you what you are gavin whispered
 i made you so you could stand up
 i made you a man
 he approached the horse and laid a hand on the stallion's quivering neck
 help me up i feel kind of stiff
 clayton lifted him gently into the saddle like a child 8
 i hate to leave my garden gavin said
 i loved my garden
 it will grow again- in california
 i loved this valley he whispered huskily
 lived alone here for three years before any man came 6
 lived alone by the river
 it was nice then so peaceful and quiet
 there was no one but me
 i don't want to leave it
 clayton swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump 8
 the two horses broke from the yard from the circle of light cast by the lamp still burning in the house into the darkness 6
 they rode at a measured pace through the valley
 dawn would come soon and the night was at its coldest 7
 the moon had sunk below the black crest of the mountains and the land seen through eyes that had grown accustomed to the absence of light looked primeval as if no man had ever trespassed before 6
 it looked as gavin had first seen it years ago on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's wind- a savage land untenanted and brooding too strong to be broken by the will of men
 in that inert landscape the caravan of his desires passed before his mind
 he saw them ambushed strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying
 in vain his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had sought so desperately but they would not come to life
 the silence oppressed him made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search 5
 they passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills
 then at last the darkness began to dissolve
 a bold line of violet broke loose from the high ridge of the mountains followed by feathers of red that swept the last stars from the sky
 the wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies
 they had been seen as soon as they left the ranch picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees 7
 the two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon crying their intelligence
 the men in pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking their faces red and baggy
 but the liquor had flushed their courage
 they greeted the news angrily as though they had been cheated of purpose
 lester heard their muttering saw their eyes reveal their desire
 he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat dry and cracked
 that's what you wanted isn't it? 4
  clayton is with him takin him out of the valley 11
 you can't-   keep out of this purvis snarled 10
 he's not your brother he's gavin's son
 you see he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone 11
 joe purvis was thinking back many years
 first he thought of the time he had ridden to gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley 6
 he remembered gavin's smirk his own cringing feeling his impotence
 then he thought of a time when clayton's horse had fallen lame in the gap
 his wife had said to him: nellie is in love with clayton roy 8
 he wouldn't even dance with her at gavin's party 9
 he treats her like she was dirt
 and you stand by like a fool and let him do it h   he remembered clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water
 it was the night clayton had tricked them in the poker game 14
 you're gavin's son joe purvis had said
 you brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find your boy
 he meant to help gavin all the time
 he made a fool of you lester
 he swung round to the other men- we can catch him easy! there are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place
 if we let them go they won't stay away they'll find men to ride with them and they'll be back
 there's only one way they can get out now and that's through the gap- if we ride hard we can take them
 lester's hand fluttered to cabot's shoulder
 he killed tom- do you understand that? 10
  cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they would do wild to break from the cloying warmth of the saloon into the cold of the ebbing night
 he fled through the door and down the steps running and the men grunted and followed pushing lester to one side where he backed against the wall with the sleeve of his jacket raised before his eyes to shut out the light
 purvis and silas pettigrew were the last to leav e 10
 they mounted up and rode slowly behind the others at a safe distance
 in the cold dawn the mist swirled low to the ground then rose with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear
 the clouds parted and hard gashes of sunlight swooped down to stain the earth with streaks of white and gold light so that the shadows of the running horses flowed like dark streams over the dazzling snow
 when they turned in the saddle they could see the men behind them strung out on the prairie in a flat black line
 the wind of their running was cold and wild the horses were lathered and their manes streamed like stiff black pennants in the wind
 the mare began to tire and clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of gavin's stallion
 he looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers 7
 they neither gained nor fell back
 he rode low on the mare's neck
 ahead of him gavin turned slightly off the trail and pointed for the gap no more than a mile away
 gavin's face was bloodless with excitement
 he did not look back; he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north 8
 he knew who was riding after him- the men he had known all his life the men who had worked for him sworn their loyalty to him 7
 now they were riding to kill him
 and he was fleeing running- fleeing his death and his life at the same time
 the land over which he sped was the land he had created and lived in: his valley
 with every leaping stride of the horse beneath him he crossed one more patch of earth that had been his that he would never see again 6
 the gap looming before him- the place where had confronted jack english on that day so many years ago- was his exit from all that had meaning to him
 california is too far he thought
 he would never reach california
 he was too old- when he passed up and through the corridor of pines that lined the trail he could see ahead he was passing from life
 the sentry was not dead
 he was in fact showing signs of reviving
 he had been carrying an enfield rifle and a holstered navy cap-and-ball pistol
 a bayonet hung in a belt scabbard
 he was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat 12
 mike stripped these from him and donned them
 he and dean tied and gagged the man using his belt and shirt for the purpose
 they dragged him inside the building
 fiske joined them unsteady on his feet
 julia seeing the bandage rushed to him
 you are hurt! she breathed
 i never felt better in my life fiske blustered 9
 he turned to susan and kissed her on the cheek
 thank you my dear he said
 mike silenced them
 first we've got to get out of here
 we'll grab horses dean said
 the main bunch is outside but there are some over there inside the wall
 mike debated it trying to decide whether fiske was strong enough to ride
 but it at least offered him a chance for living 12
 and for the sake of julia and susan it had to be tried 10
 the guerrilla bivouac remained silent
 light showed in the orderly room across t he parade ground 9
 someone evidently was on duty there
 no doubt there would be men guarding the horses 12
 about a dozen animals were held inside the stockade as best mike could make out in the moonlight
 evidently this was a precaution so that mounts would be available in an emergency
 he handed the guard's rifle to fiske
 dean and myself will try to cut out horses to ride he said 7
 you stay with the ladies
 all of you be ready to ride hell for leather
 he added if this doesn't work out the three of you barricade yourself in the house and talk terms with them
 he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol 10
 susan halted dean and kissed him
 she clung to him talking to him and dabbing at her eyes 9
 he was thinking that the way she had responded to his own kiss hadn't meant what he had believed it had
 dean turned from susan and took julia fortune in his arms 7
 he kissed her also and with deep tenderness
 she too began to weep
 he released her and joined mike
 mike only said later
 be careful mclish! susan said fiercely
 the way you were careful? 25
  he snorted
 running around in the moonlight almost naked and slugging a man with a rock? 9
  he kept going
 he wanted no more sentimental scenes with her 15
 he might say or do something foolish
 something all of them would regret
 he might tell her how sorry a spectacle she was making of herself pretending to be blind to the way julia fortune had taken dean's affections from her
 and using him mike mclish as a sop to her pride 9
 he handed the bayonet to dean and kept the pistol 8
 stay well back of me he said
 i'm going to walk up to the horses bold as brass pretending i'm one of the guerrillas
 there's bound to be someone on guard but the hat might fool them long enough for me to get close
 holding the pistol concealed he walked to the rear wall of the stockade
 it was pierced by a wagon gate built of two wings 13
 mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses 6
 they were tethered army style on stable lines
 who's thet? 15
    just me mike said
 is that you bill? 16
    he located his man
 the guard stood in the shadow of the stockade wall just out of reach of the moonlight
 mike kept walking and got within arm's reach before the man became suspicious and straightened from his lax slouch
 mike struck with the muzzle of the pistol
 but the luck that had been running their way left him 13
 the guard instinctively parried the blow with his rifle 7
 he tried to veer the rifle around to fire into mike's body 9
 mike off balance managed to bat the muzzle away a moment before it exploded
 mike swung the pistol in a savage backlash
 this time it connected solidly on the man's temple felling him 8
 the explosion of the rifle had crashed against the walls of the stockade and the deep echoes were still rolling in the hills 6
 the startled horses began rearing on their tethers 7
 are you hit? 28
  he demanded
 no but the fat's in the fire! mike said 10
 there's no chance now of all of us getting away 4
 you'll have to try it alone
 the sentry's saddled horse stood picketed nearby having been kept handy in case of need
 mike took the bayonet from dean's hand and slashed the picke t line
 up you go! he said
 ride! dean resisted mike's attempt to push him toward the horse
 why not you? 18
  he protested
 you're lighter than me
 it's our only chance now
 try to find these feds
 the rest of us can fort up in the house and hang on until you get back
 you're the one that's taking the big chance
 dean still hesitated but mike lifted him almost bodily into the saddle and thrust the reins in his hand
 no telling how good this horse is mike panted
 favor him and save something in case you hit trouble 8
 watch out for apaches when it comes daylight
 you might need it
 we'll still have the rifle and i might be able to round up some more
 i'll stampede the rest of these horses so they can't chase you 7
 dean leaned from the saddle and gave him a mighty whack on the back
 mclish he said as he kicked the horse into motion i'd be a mighty sad man if we never met again
 then he was on his way at a gallop
 mike ran down the line slashing picket ropes with the bayonet 7
 he lifted a screeching war whoop
 that touched off a total stampede
 he darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there 8
 these poured through the gate and joined the flight 9
 the animals thundered away into the moonlight heading for the ridges
 the guerrillas were swarming from their bivouac at the west end of the enclosure
 they're stealin' the stock!   he scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings
 his shout had been taken up and repeated
 the guerrillas were running across the parade ground and through the rear gate in the wake of the departing horses 8
 all were carrying guns they had seized up but they were half-clad or hardly clad at all
 durkin and calhoun came running from the post
 they had pistols in their hands
 they bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar 8
 they followed the others toward the east gate 11
 beyond the stockade rifles began to explode as some of the guerrillas fired at shadows that they imagined were apaches 5
 mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings 8
 he crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner
 a man was standing in the open door of the lighted orderly room a few yards to mike's left but he too suddenly made up his mind and went racing to join the confused activity at the east end of the stockade 7
 mike crawled to the door and peered in
 the orderly room seemed to be deserted
 a lantern hung from a peg giving light
 ducking inside he found that three rifles were stacked in a corner
 a brace of pistols holstered on belts hung from a peg along with ammunition pouches
 an ammunition case stood open containing canisters whic h contained powder cartridges
 mike seized a blanket from a pallet in a corner spread it on the floor and used it to form a bag in which he placed his booty 6
 shouldering the load he peered from the door
 his looting of the orderly room had taken only a minute or two and the vicinity was still clear of guerrillas
 he looked at the looming hoods of the supply wagons struck by a new inspiration
 he set his bundle down
 snatching the lantern from its peg he shattered its globe with a blow against a post
 he picked up the powder canister and ran out 10
 bursting paper cartridges he scattered powder beneath the nearest wagon and dumped the contents of the canister upon it
 he shouldered the blanket again backed off and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon
 he turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house
 powder flame gushed beneath the wagon
 the stockade was brilliantly lighted and the guerrillas sighted him
 bullets began to snap past him
 one struck the muzzle of one of the rifles that projected from the shoulder pack
 its force spun him around but he recovered and got into stride again
 a bullet tore the earth from beneath his foot when he was a stride or two from safety
 another struck him heavily in the thigh and he went down 6
 guerrillas were racing toward him
 susan and julia came from the door and dragged him with them 7
 the three of them floundered through the door into the interior and fell in a heap
 susan bounced to her feet and slammed the door
 she crouched aside as bullets beat at the portal chewing into the planks
 some tore entirely through the whipsawed post oak 7
 the iron hinges held but the planks were in danger of being torn from the crossbars
 mike rolled to susan grasped her around the knees dragging her off her feet
 he hovered over her to shield her for spent bullets were thudding against the rear walls
 he peered from a loophole
 guerrillas were only a dozen yards away charging the house 8
 mike snatched a pistol from the heap of scattered booty and fired
 he dropped a man with the first bullet
 at the same moment wheeler fiske fired the rifle mike had given him and another guerrilla was hit
 the guerrillas scattered for cover
 the wagons were burning fiercely
 the mudwagon had caught fire also
 the blaze was spreading to the frame buildings
 the guerrillas realized they faced a new problem 11
 there goes our grub an' ammunition!   get a bucket line going! calhoun shouted
 hurry! hurry!   the guerrillas began a frantic search for pails in which to bring water from the spring
 but what few containers they found were inadequate 11
 many of them in increasing panic came running with water in their hats in a ludicrous effort
 both buildings were in flames
 the heat drove the guerrillas back
 the roof of the command post began to buckle
 drag the wagons to the spring! lew durkin yelled
 run 'em right into the spring! hustle!   one of the wagons erupted a massive pillar of flame
 a sizable supply of powder had been touched off 10
 the wagons and the coach were beyond saving and so were the buildings
 the glow of the fire reached through the openings in the windows giving light enough to examine mike's wound
 the bullet had torn through the flesh just above the knee inflicting an ugly gash that was forming a pool of blood on the floor 5
 but it had missed the bone and had passed on through 9
 susan and julia ripped strips from their clothing and bound the injury
 mike tested the leg and found that he was able to hobble around on it
 so it wasn't the earthquake that made him return to his village! no
 now dammit i don't want to go into any more explanations 9
 keep this to yourself
 reverend jason looking worried hurried toward us
 anything wrong cap'n? 12
  the men seem to think so
 dirion found a large war party south of us
 they'll probably attack at dawn montero said
 he brushed past the clergyman and walked into the center of the camp
 using his hands as a trumpet he shouted fort up! fort up! there's a large war party on their way! for a second engages cooks voyageurs appeared struck dumb
 then little billy began shouting orders to round up the ponies and fill the water buckets and for the cooks to hurry up with the meal 5
 they all flew into action
 that was a terrible thing to do i said to oso 11
 the aricaras treated us like friends
 and here all the time you knew the sioux would be using our rifles on them! god what a world you people live in 5
 oso gave me an unruffled look
 old knife's got the largest war party ever seen on the river he said calmly
 what would you have done in montero's moccasins? 13
  let old knife come up and kill you and your people or would you steer him on someone else? 6
  he shook his head
 mr manuel did that in the war
 that's why the british never got the tribes to fight for the king
 mr manuel whispered in the ears of the sioux that the cheyennes were comin' to raid 'em for their horses
 then he went on to the cheyennes and told them that the sioux was goin' to move up
 he did that with all the nations
 hell they were fightin' each other so hard they had no time for anyone else
 the war department wrote mr manuel a letter and said he was a hero
 he carried it in a little wallet made of fish skin 13
 but that was war i said
 there's no war on now
 in this country there's a war on every time the grass turns green 10
 first it was the nations against themselves then it was them against the whites
 and it's goin' to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land
 i remember being told it would happen so fast people would think it took place overnight
 that's why this company's important
 once we get over the mountains others will come along 11
 that's why the trust don't want us to make it 3
 that bastard chambers!- old knife's not the only chief he'll get to do his dirty work! before we get through he'll have the blackfeet hankerin' for our hair and our goods
 well talkin' ain't goin' to help- let's fort up!   as i dug in behind one of the bales we were using as protection i grudgingly found myself agreeing with oso's logic especially when i imagined what would have happened to missy if old knife's large party of screeching warriors had overrun our company
 for unlike the sioux and the crows the aricaras are not great horsemen nor are they aggressive like the savage blackfeet 7
 more of an agricultural nation they have relied on their warriors only for defense and for survival in the endless wars of the plains
 still i was disgusted with myself for agreeing with montero's methods
 surprisingly he had told the others what he had done 6
 in the brief moment i had to talk to them before i took my post on the ring of defenses i indicated i was sickened by the methods men employed to live and trade on the river
 i think montero did right amy said firmly
 let the savages kill each other what do we care? 11
  reverend jason was understandably bitter
 it was a terrible thing to do
 but oso replied calmly trouble ain't easy to dodge out in this country rev'rend
 gray eyes attacked our camp just as the first pink threads stitched together the hills and the sky
 our camp was in the center of a wide valley 11
 montero had set up a strong position using every bale and box we had in addition to barricades of logs and brush
 he had ordered the ponies brought inside the fortified circle and had assigned pierre and a band of picked engages the job of trying to keep them steady under fire
 the pony herd was the one flaw in our defense; the rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible 8
 wildly bucking horses would make the position difficult to defend against charging warriors
 the cooks had prepared one of the best meals we'd had in a long time and on montero's orders had baked enough bread to last the day 9
 buckets were filled the herd fed and watered
 the worst part had been the waiting; although we didn't expect the attack before dawn the long cloudy night filled with the sounds of the industrious insects seemed endless
 coyotes and hunting wolves sounded like signaling indian scouts the whinny of a restless pony made one's skin crawl 5
 oso slept unconcernedly his rifle cradled in his arms; i didn't catch a wink
 every time i closed my eyes i saw gray eyes rushing at me with a knife
 it was a relief when they finally came
 they poured through the opening in the valley then spread out in a long line to come at us brandishing their lances and filling the morning with their spine-chilling scalp cry
 oso montero called i'll get gray eyes
 that'll be a pleasure to see the big black murmured as he stared down the barrel of his rifle
 hold your fire montero was shouting
 i'll shoot the first man who doesn't
 i could see them in my sights
 they were about a mile off; under me the ground quivered slightly
 at first they were only feathers and dark indistinguishable faces and bodies hunched over their horses' heads
 gradually they emerged as men
 gray eyes was in the lead
 his face was split by a vermilion streak his eyes were pools of white; jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest 5
 he was naked except for a clout
 next to him was a young boy i was sure had sat near me at one of the trading sessions
 his mouth was open his neck corded with the strain of his screams
 i found his chest in my sights
 it had a red circle
 the circle came nearer and nearer
 my god how long is he going to wait i thought h
 at first i thought he had missed
 the feathered lance was still above his head 10
 as he started to slump over another warrior swung him onto his horse
 at the last second i dropped my sights from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of his pony
 i saw the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior flew over its head bouncing like a rubber ball
 he started to run but oso's shot caught him on the wing 10
 he jerked once in the grass and lay still
 if you're goin' to kill 'em- kill 'em! oso growled 8
 what else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides
 the aricaras broke under the devastating fire wheeled and retreated
 lead up! lead up! they'll be back! montero was shouting 6
 far up the valley i could see the rees circling and reorganizing
 out in front of our walls the grass was covered with dead and dying men war shields lances blankets and wounded and dead horses 6
 the morning air was filled with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood the acrid stench of frightened horses and the bitterness of burned powder
 a horse screamed as it twisted from side to side in a frenzy 6
 a rifle cracked; the square head fell over
 one of the warriors suddenly leaped to his feet and began running across the valley to the trees that lined the small creek 8
 his legs pumped furiously his long black hair streamed out behind him
 there was a ragged volley
 he was dead before he hit the ground
 for christ's sake don't waste your powder on one of 'em! montero shouted furiously
 wait for the charge! the charge i tell you!   the sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint
 they grew louder as the indians charged again
 i could see their faces glistening with sweat and bear grease their mouths open shouting their spine- chilling cries 9
 gray eyes is back montero said
 the war captain had been badly wounded and was fighting to hold his seat
 i could see the blood running down his chest 14
 he was riding between two warriors who held him erect when he started to slump
 in my sights i watched him looming bigger and bigger 9
 montero's shot had caught him high in the chest; there was no doubt he was dying
 again we waited for montero
 this time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically but they held their fire
 the horses were only several lengths away when he fired 9
 the bullet flung gray eyes from his horse
 our rolling volley swept most of the other riders from their mounts
 but a few reached our wall
 i heard the whir of an ax and a canadian's face burst apart in a bloody spray
 i saw little billy rise and fire almost point blank and an indian's face became shattered flesh and bone
 a second leaped from his horse to the top of the bale firing four arrows in such rapid succession it didn't seem possible they were in flight
 oso reached up jerked the buck from the bale and snapped his neck
 other indians were running at the ponies shrilling and waving blankets
 reverend jason got one the canadians the others 9
 i saw the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitching body of the man he had shot then run back to his position
 the ponies were almost uncontrollable
 the pall of dust they raised made it difficult to see when the aricaras charged again
 this time more of them hurdled the barrier
 a small indian dived at montero who caught him with a swift upward stroke of his rifle butt
 it sounded like a man kicking a melon
 above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales
 although my shot killed his horse he rolled off the bale on top of me
 i could smell woodsmoke grease and oil
 his eyes were dark fluid fearful and he gave a sigh as my knife went in
 coming over the wall he had seemed like a hideous devil 6
 now under me i could see him for what he really was a boy dressed up in streaks of paint h
 the aricaras made one last desperate charge
 it was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors old and young wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient hawkinses
 others badly wounded gripped hands in manes knees in bellies held on as long as possible and then weak from ghastly wounds slipped sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be broken under the slashing hoofs
 some gracefully soared from the backs of their wounded screaming mounts to make one last defiant charge before the lead split their hearts or tore their guts h
 none of them reached our walls again
 the few survivors grudgingly turned away
 in the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song
 she was carrying a quirt and she started to raise it then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist
 i saw your fire she said speaking slowly making an effort to control her anger
 you could burn down this whole mountainside with a fire that size 8
 it wouldn't matter to a fool like you
 all right wilson said quickly
 and i appreciate the advice
 he was losing patience again
 an hour before with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness he would have appreciated company
 she had helped him change his mind
 i'm not advising you she said
 that fire's too big
 and make sure it's out when you leave in the morning 8
 it took him a long time to compose himself 13
 there's some mistake he said finally
 you're right about the fire
 it's bigger than it has to be though i don't see where it's doing any harm
 but you're wrong about the rest of it
 i'm not leaving in the morning
 why should i? 24
  i own the place
 she showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face 7
 it didn't seem to tell her anything
 she glanced around the clearing taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground the two kids the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight
 she studied it for a long time
 then she turned back to wilson and smiled and he wasn't quite sure what she meant by it
 you own this place? 15
  she said and her tone had softened until it was almost friendly
 you bought it? 19
  from a man in st louis wilson said
 the girl laughed
 i ought to
 my father ran him off here six years ago
 he stood watching the girl wondering what was coming next 11
 she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him
 carwood didn't tell you that she said
 but it's understandable
 it's not the kind of thing that a man would be proud of 4
 and it doesn't make any difference
 he sold me a clear title
 i have it with me right here
 if you want to see-   never mind she said sternly 20
 it wouldn't matter to my father and not to me
 i meant what i said about that fire
 be sure it's out when you leave
 i'll let you go back to doing the dishes now
 it was meant to insult him and didn't quite succeed 11
 he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly and it was his turn to smile now
 i don't mind washing dishes now and then he said pleasantly 4
 it might hurt you though
 somebody might mistake you for a woman
 he meant to say more but he never got the chance 10
 she brought the quirt down slashing it across his cheek and he tried to step back
 she swung the quirt again and this time he caught her wrist and pulled her out of the saddle
 she came down against him and he tried to break her fall 8
 he grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him 8
 it made him a little sick and he let go of her 10
 he got up slowly and she was already on her feet and he stood facing her
 he wiped the blood from his cheek
 i ought to- he said
 he was shaking with anger his breath coming in long painful gasps
 that quirt- i ought to use it on you where it would do the most good
 if you were a man-   she isn't mister
 the voice came from behind him and wilson turned 10
 the fire had gone down and the man was only a shadow against the trees
 but a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light and wilson had a good look at him
 he was tall and dark-skinned a half-breed wilson thought 10
 and he was handsome despite the long thin scar that slanted across his cheek
 she's not a man mister he said
 if you've got any ideas
 he raised the winchester and pointed it at wilson's chest 8
 put the rifle down joseph the girl said
 i thought i told you to stay home
 the half-breed eased the winchester down and rested it across his lap
 the scar looked pure white in the half-darkness; his eyes were black and deep-set and expressionless
 you shouldn't be riding up here after dark judith he said quietl y 10
 i can take care of this
 it's no job for you
 the girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him
 he took it without flinching
 i said go home joseph
 you've got no business up here
 the half-breed didn't answer this time
 but the scar seemed to pull hard at the corner of his mouth and his eyes were hurt and angry
 he watched the half-breed as he turned silently
 they could hear the pony's feet on the dry leaves for a while then the sound faded out
 wilson brushed the dust from his coat
 who was that? 15
  he asked
 your personal guard? 15
  you're pretty hard on him
 he works for my father the girl said and then seemed to change her mind
 his name's joseph sanchez
 is there anything else you want to know? 17
  not now wilson said
 i guess i'll find out soon enough
 you've got blood on your cheek
 it must have got there when you fell against me 12
 she wiped it off with the sleeve of her coat
 i'll bet that's as close as you've been to a man since you were a baby wilson said
 he saw her hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt and he grabbed her wrist
 oh no he said and he was without humor now
 i've had enough of that
 i've had enough of you
 i don't know what goes on around here and i don't care 4
 i don't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business and i don't care about that either
 you took me by surprise
 but i'll know how to handle you next time
 she brought up her free hand to hit him but this time he was quicker
 he side-stepped her blow and she fell stumbling against the gelding
 she finally regained her balance and got up in the saddle 8
 her hat had come off and fallen behind her shoulders held by the string and he could see her face more clearly than he had at any time before
 he had forgotten that she was so pretty
 but her prettiness was what he had noticed first and all the other things had come afterward: cruelty meanness self-will 9
 he had known women like that one woman in particular 10
 and one had been too many
 he watched the girl until she had gone into the trees and waited until he couldn't hear the sound of her horse any longer then went up to where the children were sleeping
 they weren't sleeping of course but they thought they were doing him a favor by pretending
 he hadn't shown up too well in their eyes letting himself be browbeaten by a woman
 they expected greater things from him regardless of how trying the circumstances and they were disappointed
 and determined not to show it
 they lay a little too stiffly with their eyes straining to stay closed
 go to sleep he said
 there's better things to do than listen to something like that 5
 i'll be down at the creek finishing the dishes if you want me 5
 he found the pan where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream
 the coyote was calling again and he hoped that this time there would be no other sounds to interrupt it
 not tonight at any rate
 he had a feeling that the girl meant trouble
 if she did he could stand it better in the light 12
 he scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out
 that afternoon when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house his hopes had been high
 already some of the pain had gone from amelia's death 8
 there would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief
 but they were starting a new life
 and they had almost everything they needed: land a house two whiteface bulls three horses
 the land wasn't all wilson had expected of it 9
 six hundred and forty acres the old man back in st louis had said; good grass good water
 well the grass was there though in some places the ground was too steep for a cow to get to it
 the water was there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard
 and there was a house; livable perhaps but badly in need of repairs
 in the last analysis though wilson had little cause to complain
 the place had been cheap- just the little he had left after amelia's burial- and it would serve its purpose
 there was only one place where jake carwood's description had gone badly awry: the peace and quiet
 it hadn't started out that way
 and he had a feeling- thanks to the girl- that things would get worse before they got better
 they had the house cleaned up by noon and wilson sent the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horses
 he stood on the porch and watched him struggling with the heavy harness and finally went over to help him
 kathy was already in the wagon
 they were going to town and they were both excited 15
 wilson backed the team into the traces and wished they weren't going to town at all
 he had an uneasy feeling about it
 that girl last night what was her name? 9
  judith pierce
 it was the only thing about her that was the least bit hard to remember
 he finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him
 he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than judith pierce had made it seem
 there was brush and stands of pine that no grass could grow under and places so steep that cattle wouldn't stop to graze
 there was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard
 yes there was plenty of water too much and that was probably the trouble
 there were tracks of cattle all over his six hundred and forty acres
 the first part of the road was steep but it leveled off after the second bend and curled gradually into the valley
 it was hotter once they reached the flat and drier but the grass was better
 a warm breeze played across it moving it like waves 9
 a red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road
 it took them an hour before they came to the first houses of kelseyville
 the town was about what wilson expected: one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings a water tower a few warehouses a single hotel; all dusty and sunbaked
 such was my state of mind that i did not question the possibility of this; under the circumstances i was only too willing to confess all
 i was nearly thirty at the time
 i went to the hall in the afternoons only on these preliminary matters
 it was dark and i sensed very large; only the counter at one end was lighted by a long fluorescent tube suspended directly above it 6
 sometimes i was aware of people moving about in the darkness 12
 i would turn away from my writing in the hope of getting a good look at them but i never quite succeeded
 a glimpse of three of four vague figures at the most 9
 squatting as if waiting
 the pulsing glow of a cigarette
 since they could see me but i not them their presence in the hall disturbed me
 the clerk paid them no attention
 this impressed me until i realized how limited was his sphere of influence
 his job simply consisted in registering new men
 when the phone rang he answered it
 his authority extended to the far edge of the counter no further 11
 none of the men hanging around the hall bothered to speak to him
 baldness was attacking his pate
 he spoke to me in a gruff voice an affectation which quite belied his personality
 he wore his white shirt open at the neck revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath
 it was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he wa s
 but it was not easy for him and he often slipped 23
 when one of the men in the hall behind us spat on the floor and scraped his boot over the gob of spittle i noticed how the clerk winced
 i felt certain he was really a spineless little man 10
 his hat hung on a hook on the wall and underneath it i could see his tie knotted ready to be slipped over his head a black badge of frayed respectability that ought never to have left his neck 5
 the morning's tabloids were on the counter and a stack of dog-eared men's magazines
 on a shelf in the office behind the counter was a small radio dialed permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercials and cheap popular music
 everything about the clerk was trivial
 once pressing him i learned that his job was only part-time in the afternoons when nothing went on in the hall
 noticing my disappointment he attempted to salvage what scraps and shreds of authority he felt might still be clinging to his person
 with distaste i saw him assume a pompous air
 when he saw me coming he turned his radio off 14
 he made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf 10
 he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence then bark into it with gruff importance
 what limited knowledge he possessed he forced upon me 8
 in the mornings i was informed fluorescent tubes similar to the one above the counter illuminated the entire hall
 they and the two large fans which i could dimly see as daylight filtered through their vents down at the far end of the hall could be turned on by a master switch situated inside the office
 he pointed out the switch to me and for a moment i foolishly believed that he would let deed follow words
 i was shown instead a batch of white tickets of the sort handed out he told me every morning
 now here was something of obvious importance to me yet when i reached for the tickets he snatched them away from my hand 6
 he couldn't afford to have anyone mess around with them he said 6
 each of those tickets was of great value to its rightful recipient 10
 later i would remember what this pompous little man had told me about the worth of a ticket
 having nothing else to do except wait for my forms to be processed i gave myself over to speculations concerning the hall itself 6
 when suitably lighted what would it look like? 9
  the presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air
 one afternoon upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk i had visited the toilet adjoining the hall
 by counting the number of stalls and urinals i attempted to form a loose estimate of how many men the hall would hold at one time 7
 for although i had crossed a corner of the hall on my way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extended
 i could observe the two fans down at the end but their size in themselves meant nothing to me as long as i had no measure of comparison
 i had for some time been hoping in vain for one of the dim figures to pass between the fan vents and myself
 i knew that three or four of them were almost always present in the hall but what they were doing and exactly where i could not tell 9
 it was i felt possible that they were men who having received no tickets for that day had remained in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corners farthest removed from the counter with its overhead light
 this light did not penetrate very far back into the hall and my eyes were hindered rather than aided by the dim daylight entering through the fan vents when i tried to pick out whatever might be lying or squatting on the floor below
 also the clerk appeared to disapprove of my frequent curious glances back over my shoulder
 no sooner wou ld i turn my head away from the counter before he would address me at times quite sharply in order to bring back my attention
 and i had hardly finished my business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the lights in that place like the hall lights controlled from the switch in the office flicked off and on impatiently
 this sort of petty vigilance annoyed me
 i felt certain it was self-appointed
 it sprang from a type of mentality i'd encountered often enough but certainly had not expected to find here
 i decided to see no more of the clerk until the processing of my papers was completed
 i felt strongly attached to the hall however and hardly a day passed when i did not go to look at it from a distance
 i lived in a state of suspense because of it 10
 i could not cling to my past nor did i wish to 11
 i had signed it off on the forms
 my future lay solely with the hall yet what did i know about the hall at this point? 7
  although i had been inside it i had not yet seen it functioning 6
 i wished to prepare myself but did not even know what sort of clothes i ought to be wearing
 i did not despair however; far from it! i was constantly searching for clues around the neighborhood of the hall 6
 though only a relatively short walk separated it from my own part of town its character was wholly foreign to me
 large warehouses flanked the street on which the hall fronted 7
 the river was only a few blocks away but an unbroken line of piers prevented me from seeing it
 sometimes i noticed the tops of ships' masts and funnels reaching above the pier roofs
 the sounds issuing from beyond- winches whirring men shouting- indicated great activity and excited me
 the hall on the other hand appeared lifeless and deserted on these long waterfront afternoons
 it resembled nothing i'd ever seen before
 its front was windowless but irregularities in the masonry might be an indication that windows now blinded had once looked out upon the street
 i kept circling the block hoping to see from the street behind it the rear of the hall
 but it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it
 for weeks i wandered about this neighborhood of warehouses and garages truck terminals and taxi repair shops gasoline pumps and longshoremen's lunch counters yet never did i cease to feel myself a stranger there
 i returned to the hall despite my dislike for the clerk 9
 as i had expected he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application 10
 meanwhile spring had passed well into summer
 at last when i put it to him directly the clerk was forced to admit that the delay in my case was unusual
 when i asked him what if anything i could do about it he surprised me by referring me to the director of the hall 8
 i could consult this personage on any weekday morning though no t before ten o'clock
 the clerk impressed this upon me: that i should not arrive in the hall before ten o'clock
 when i went for my interview with the director i saw why 11
 although it was dark as usual i could see that the hall had only recently contained a great many people
 cigarette butts littered the floor
 the big fans were going drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling
 i had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs 11
 the staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men
 i stopped by the counter
 no one was behind it but in the rear wall of the office i noticed for the first time a door which had been left partially open 7
 past it i could see part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on the floor
 i rapped my knuckles on the counter
 the director came to the door
 i was at once disappointed although just what i had expected him to look like i could not have explained
 he was a man in his late forties with graying hair of medium height; he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar
 he wore perforated white-topped shoes; they somehow made me expect to see him launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment
 but he came toward me sedately enough showed me around the counter offered me a seat inside his office then walked to a file cabinet and got out my application
 i had the impression that he had read my forms perhaps several times
 he did not look at them now
 as he lowered himself on the chair behind his desk i wondered what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the workings of the hall
 he spoke in a voice as immaculate as his appearance 12
 why had i registered? 14
  begging my pardon he must express his astonishment over seeing a person of my background applying at the hall
 he had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there; indeed my scholastic qualifications were such that he a college graduate himself must envy me them
 was i sure he asked that i knew what i was applying for? 8
  what sort of men i would come into contact with at the hall? 9
  these questions did not surprise me; i felt certain that the director like the afternoon clerk seldom moved beyond the counter that the hall to them was a jungle a dark and unwelcome place 6
 though i doubted that he would understand me i told the director my motives for applying
 i had always i said hankered after working hard with my hands 11
 this desire i went on growing voluble as my conviction was aroused had mounted at such a rate recently that i now found its realization necessary not only to my physical but also to my spiritual wellbeing
 to this effect i had already severed all connections which bound me to my former existence
 the flat hard cap was small but he thrust it to the back of his head
 hell with it
 before they could guess his intention rankin stepped forward and swung the guard's own gun against the uncovered head hard 5
 the man went over without sound falling to the bare floor 11
 barton said harshly why did you do that? 7
    rankin sneered at him
 what did you want me to do kiss him? 7
  he dumped me in solitary twice
 barton caught the lighter man's shoulder and swung him around 6
 let's get one thing straight you and me
 the only reason we brought you was to get miller out 6
 if you ever try anything without my orders i'll kill you 13
 fred rankin looked at him
 it seemed to barton that the green eyes mocked him the thin-lipped smile held insolence but he had no time to waste now
 they filed out through the guard-room door into the paved square 7
 there were three other men within this prison whom barton would have liked to liberate but they were in other cell blocks 9
 they moved slowly toward the main gate following the wall 8
 they had chosen this night purposely
 they reached the guard house without alerting the men on the walls above and powers slipped through the door
 two men were on duty inside playing pinochle relaxed 10
 they looked up in surprise as powers came i n
 what are you doing out of the block? 16
    it's curtiss he said naming the man rankin had hit 3
 i've got to have help
 the sergeant in charge climbed to his feet
 what's wrong with him? 8
    he's having some kind of a fit
 the sergeant turned to the door
 as he passed through it barton shoved his gun against the man's side
 one sound and you're dead
 powers had not followed
 powers was covering the remaining guard
 the man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell 9
 powers knocked his arm aside
 deliberately with none of rankin's viciousness he laid the barrel of his gun alongside the guard's head
 even barton could not quite believe it
 it had gone without a hitch
 they slid through the wicket in the big gate ghosted across the dark ground
 five minutes later they reached the horses
 barton was relieved to see that carl dill and emmett foster had brought extra mounts
 he had been worried that with miller and rankin added to the escape party they would be short
 they walked the horses heading along the river barton and emmett foster in the lead seven men riding quietly through the night 7
 the only thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform of prison guards three the striped suits of convicts 6
 in a small grove against the river they halted turning deep into the protection of the trees
 foster had brought extra clothing also
 he had been one of the original night riders one who had escaped the trial
 it was to him that barton had sent carl dill on dill's release from the prison
 clyde miller was crying softly to himself shedding his striped suit and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants the worn brown shirt
 kid boyd was unusually silent rankin watchful a few paces apart 6
 barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to powers 7
 i won't even try to thank you
 the ex-prison guard was embarrassed
 he said in a studied voice i didn't do it for you 11
 i did it for the valley
 you're the only man the night riders will follow 6
 we've been starving and i don't like to starve
 barton turned away his eyes falling upon rankin beside his horse 6
 the murderer lifted his head
 meaning you want me to ride out? 7
    you aren't one of us
 there's nothing for you here
 i got no place to go
 he did not trust rankin his violent temper his killer instinct
 but ten years in prison had taught him realities 11
 they were in a fight outweighed in both numbers and money 10
 it was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses to call them night riders to set out to attack the largest mining combination the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure 8
 but if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals men who knew how to use a gun against men who would match the killers on the other side
 your choice he said briefly and turned to kid boyd 10
 bury those uniforms so they won't be found
 then barton touched carl dill's arm and moved off up the river bank
 he wanted a careful uninterrupted report from dill on the conditions in the valley
 they squatted on their heels in the deep mud and dill found a cigar in his breast pocket passing it over silently
 he too knew the agony of going for weeks sometimes months without the solace of tobacco
 mitchell barton drew in the fragrance deeply letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat for a moment before he exhaled 6
 through the gloom he could not see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly
 for his first five years in prison they had shared a cell 10
 carl dill was neither a rancher nor a valley man
 he had been the auditor for the mining syndicate and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money 11
 he had done time for the theft
 the one thing they had in common was their hatred 9
 it had drawn them together and since his release from prison dill had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape 6
 he said now i've got the perfect headquarters set up 8
 mitch barton knew the place
 twenty years before a group of easterners had bought out the haskell claims in the rocky hills south of grass valley
 they had spent a million dollars carving in a road putting up buildings drilling their haulage tunnel
 then the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned
 the road's washed badly said dill but there's a trail you can get over with a horse
 a company of cavalry couldn't come in there if two men were guarding that trail
 how do the valley people feel? 12
    as mad as ever
 but kruger's men keep them off balance and they don't trust me 5
 when they learn you're in the hills though they'll rally don't worry about that
 barton waited for a long moment then asked the question which lay always uppermost in his mind
 did you find him? 17
    dill was silent as if he hated to answer and barton had a cold sick feeling of apprehension
 barton half-straightened in surprise
 what's he doing there? 7
    again dill hesitated
 dealing faro? 12
  how come? 23
    your sister- in-law has the faro bank in cap ayres' saloon 7
 barton cursed under his breath
 after another long pause he asked how many people know who they are? 7
    everyone
 your cousin finley saw to that
 he's quite a rat you know
 he sold out to kruger's men
 he's informed them of everything you've ever written him 5
 barton stood up
 he said tensely all right
 let's go get the boy
 dill had come up also
 i was afraid of this
 i almost didn't tell you
 if you hadn't i'd have killed you
 but you can't ride into the ferry
 that's what they'll expect you to do
 they'll be there waiting for you
 i understand how you feel about the child h
 barton's voice was rougher than dill had ever heard it 8
 my wife died in childbirth after i was sent away
 i can't leave him there
 donald kruger would like nothing better than to hold him as hostage and i wouldn't entrust a snake to his tender care 5
 i've got to get the boy
 two barton's men cut the telegraph wires in half a dozen places carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult 5
 it was over an hour before their escape was discovered but still the news that barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state
 it reached donald kruger in his massive home in burlingame 9
 it reached the mines at north san juan and bloomfield 11
 it brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences 7
 for everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg and mitchell barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence
 creighton hague sat in his office above the ione pit 6
 the office was of logs four rooms each heated by an iron stove 7
 the building was dwarfed by the scene outside
 there a dozen giant monitors played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside
 the gravel was the bed of an ancient river buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of earth
 it was partially cemented by ages and pressure yet it crumpled before the onslaught of the powerful streams the force of a thousand fire hoses and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices
 a million dollars' of gold a month
 a million tons of rock and soil and brush 11
 the monitors ran twenty-four hours each day
 their roar like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could be heard for miles
 hague like all who worked near the pits was partly deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums
 he was a big man wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill air
 fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt
 ten years older than mitch barton he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits to manager of the operation
 he was proud of his accomplishments proud of his job proud that donald kruger and his associates trusted him
 he lived and breathed for the mining company 14
 no man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless and hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life 5
 there came a ghost of noise at the office door and hague swung to see kodyke in the entrance from the outer room
 hague had never accustomed himself to kodyke
 the man was tall thin with a narrow face and a too-large nose 11
 the eyes always held hague eyes of a dead man lidless as a lizard's with the fixed intensity of a cobra
 even hague was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was kodyke
 he knew nothing about the man's history
 kodyke had appeared at the mine one day bearing a letter from kruger
 kodyke was to head the dread company police
 he ran the change rooms
 he threw out the hi-graders
 he supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw gold which each week went out to san francisco
 hague squeezed down his uneasy dislike
 he pulled open the top drawer of his desk and drew out a tintype
 he broke out of folsom last night
 apparently he bribed one of the guards
 we want him back there or we want him dead
 kodyke took the picture in a lean hand studying it thoughtfully 7
 you know how the ranchers in the valley are
 they blame us for all their troubles
 ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches
 it cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them
 we don't want barton's night riders loose again 6
 the gunman nodded slipping the picture into his breast pocket saying nothing
 normally hague wasted no words but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although he knew kodyke was aware of all he said 5
 if she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother she did not comment upon it
 after they had finished eating melissa took sprite the kitten under her arm- so that auntie grace can teach it about the whistle- and climbed into the station wagon beside her mother 5
 she had offered to walk but pamela knew she would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called auntie 7
 when they reached their neighbor's house pamela said a few polite words to grace and kissed melissa lightly on the forehead the impulse prompted by a stray thought- of the type to which she was frequently subject these days- that they might never see one another again 5
 then she turned the station wagon around and headed it back down the hill with the village as her ostensible destination 8
 as she drove she thought about her plan
 it was really quite simple
 so simple in fact that it might even work- although pamela now in her new frame of mind was careful not to pretend too much assurance
 that mistake she thought had cost her dearly these past few days and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of the traps that the mountain might set for her
 she must be cautious so as not to alert the scheming forest 7
 when the station wagon drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the culver house pamela turned the wheel guiding the car to its familiar parking spot close to the house and stopped
 all of her movements were careful and methodical partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime
 she locked the ignition removed the keys stepped out of the car and went into the house
 here she dropped the keys on a small table beside the door and went upstairs to her bedroom
 on her bureau lay a small brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving- an object which pamela believed now had been the property of her great-grandfather major hiram munroe culver 7
 he had belonged to this land and perhaps had desecrated it- and this was the only material symbol that remained of him
 if she pamela were being held responsible for his crimes then hers must be the final act of expiation
 she would return this symbol to the mountain as one pours seed back into the soil every spring h or as ancient fertility cults demand annual human sacrifice
 slowly and thoughtfully she slipped the ornament into th e pocket of her slacks moved down the stairs and out of the house 6
 there was only one place where the mountain might receive her- that unnamed unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom 8
 atonement if atonement were possible could only be made at that sacred sacrificial basin
 it was there that she would have to enact her renunciation beg forgiveness
 perhaps it was insane pamela thought
 perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream
 but she was caught in it and she faced the terrible possibility that if it were a dream it was one from which she might never awaken
 facing the forest now she who had not dared to enter it before walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool
 she remembered little of her previous journey there with grace and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it
 the forest was open and freely welcoming extending an enchanted hand
 the ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle
 birds chirped and chattered in the trees and the sun all dewy-eyed and soft caressed her shoulders warmly from time to time 5
 it was not thought pamela such an evil place after all 16
 no wonder melissa responded so completely to its beckoning 8
 perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed
 was it not possible after all that the forest was in league with her and her child h that its sympathy lay with the culvers h that she had erred in failing to understand this? 5
    pamela felt calm and peaceful as she walked along 8
 the slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear 4
 she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants
 having persisted too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her pamela was relieved now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward grappling with them
 a few days ago she would have thought such an expedition as this utterly ridiculous; today on the contrary it seemed utterly reasonable
 she did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail; she directed all of her mental and physical energy toward achieving this one goal
 if as she walked her steps fumbled from time to time she chose to ignore that omen
 if the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim she tried not to heed
 success depended upon maintaining her equanimity; she must be poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she was in earnest
 the forest took on an impersonal aspect
 it did not care what sort of person prowled its woods plucked at its bark or stripped the berries from its bushes
 unconcerned indifferent unmotivated the forest was simply there- fighting man's depredations with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical evening laughter 5
 red man or white man pacifist or killer the forest would accept them all- knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence; knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man
 she must not think about time
 that was another one of those traps
 in her grim pursuit of tranquillity pamela focused her thoughts on her husband
 if when this was all over she found the words to tell him about it she wondered if he would ever understand
 how could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent? 8
  indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights nor would his days be haunted by the dimly-outlined ill-conceived figure of her benighted ancestor
 his bright daylight mind would whistle away such images; they would not dare to face his scoffing
 pamela was glad jim was nowhere near
 his presence would have interfered with her duty 8
 the mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once or twice on the smooth pine needles
 the trees huddled more closely together their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against the sun
 bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours for the struggling stranger and without the direct light of the sun to act as compass pamela could no longer be positive of her direction 6
 nevertheless she continued to move upward
 she was sure she would reach the pool by climbing and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles 9
 the forest had become an alien world where she strove alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever hindrances were offered 6
 it was a bold dark castle of pine boughs that stood like a medieval fortress eclipsing the sun and human time 10
 at one and the same time she was within it but still searching for the drawbridge that would give her entry
 silence came into the forest- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees
 silence walked at pamela's side its presence numbingly close yet too far for her to hear
 silence stood in front of her waiting and in back of her blocking her retreat
 she stumbled over the root of a tree that protruded maliciously above the earth
 in spite of her attempt to preserve her balance she fell bruising her arm on a naked stone
 for a moment she could not catch her breath and then her breath returning in short frightened spasms she lifted herself to her feet laboriously
 she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes
 her arm bled slightly and the offended skin cried out in pain 6
 she was bewildered
 she seemed to have come such a long distance- too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees
 she stood quite still trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn a path to follow a clue to guide her
 she was standing in a thick grove
 the trees were crowded so closely together that their branches overlapped virtually shutting out the sun completely 7
 the earth smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing effect of the sun's rays
 she had the feeling that under the mouldering leaves there would be the bodies of dead animals quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain
 the thought made pamela shudder
 a terrible chill swept through the grove
 not a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove catching pamela in a leering embrace
 there was a peculiar density about it a thick substance that could be sensed but never identified never actually perceived 10
 where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such a scene? 6
  she already knew this unwholesome chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive
 it enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles 9
 it crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin
 it crawled across her breasts suffocating the life in her nipples
 it circled her thighs exploring with its icy tentacles 12
 it entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and its particles spreading creeping crawling joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached; stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps; clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws
 she had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain depriving her of reason and sight
 but she did not know which way to go
 the shadows of the trees engulfed her foreclosing every possible exit from the grove
 she had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around her throat in ever-tightening circles
 she could not scream for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth who would hear who would listen? 7
    does the mountain listen? 17
  pamela groped blindly
 she had to move in some direction- any direction that would take her away from this evil place
 she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back
 her own body protested aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed where cold demon wisps still clung and caressed 5
 every movement she made seemed unnecessarily noisy 10
 twigs cracked loudly under her feet; bushes swished and scratched at her slacks; tree branches snapped as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her
 miraculously she found exactly the right statement 9
 she began it deliberately so that none of her words would be lost on him
 i want to tell you something thomas demontez lord 16
 i'm well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg and that i don't amount to anything
 but-   but it don't matter a-tall lord supplied fondly 8
 to me you'll always be the girl o' my dreams an' the sweetest flower that grows
 beaming idiotically he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her
 she yanked away from him furiously
 you shut up! shu- tt up-pp! i've got something to say to you and by god you're going to listen
 do you hear me? 18
  you're going to listen! lord nodded agreeably
 he said he wanted very much to listen
 he knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would be plumb important as well as pleasin' to the ear and he didn't want to miss a word of it
 so would she mind speaking a little louder? 8
  i think you stink tom lord! i think you're mean and hateful and stupid and- louder? 6
  said joyce
 so i can hear you while i'm checkin' the car 11
 looks like we might be in for a speck of trouble 7
 he opened the door and got out
 he waited at the car side for a moment looking down at her expectantly
 well? 19
  wasn't you goin' to say somethin'? 6
  then helpfully as she merely stared at him in weary silence maybe you could write it down for me huh? 7
  print it in real big letters an' i can cipher it out later 5
 aah go on she said
 just go the hell on
 he grinned nodded and walked around to the front of the car 12
 lips pursed mournfully he stared down at its crazily sagging left side
 then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots peered into the orderly chaos of axle shock absorber and spring 7
 he went prone on his stomach the better to pursue his examination
 after a time he straightened again brushing the red permian dust from his hands slapping it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored twenty-five-dollar shirt
 he wore no gun- a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country
 never he'd once told joyce had he encountered any man or situation that called for a gun
 and he really feels that way she thought
 that's really all he's got all he is
 just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package 8
 if i could make myself feel the same way h   she studied him hopefully yearningly; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis
 here in the god-forsaken place the westerly end of nowhere tom lord looked almost insignificant almost contemptible
 he was handsome with his coal-black hair and eyes his fine-chiseled features
 but she'd known plenty of handsomer guys and conceding his good looks what was there left? 6
  he wasn't a big man; rather on the medium side 10
 neither was he very powerful of build
 he could move very quickly she knew but he was more wiry than truly strong
 and his relatively small hands and feet gave him an almost delicate appearance
 just nothing she told herself
 just so darned sure of himself that he puts the indian sign on everyone
 but by gosh i want him and i'm going to have him! he caught her eye came back around the car with the boot-wearer's teetering half-mincing walk
 why did these yokels still wear boots anyway when most had scarcely sat a horse in years? 6
  he slid in at her side tucked a cigar into his mouth and politely proffered one to her
 oh cut it out tom! she snapped
 can't you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute? 8
  this ain't your brand maybe lord suggested
 or maybe you just don't feel like a cigar? 9
    i feel like getting back to town that's what i feel like! now are you going to take me or am i supposed to walk? 6
    might get there faster walkin' lord drawled seein' as how i got a busted front spring
 on the other hand howsomever maybe you wouldn't either 15
 i figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk and i c'n maybe get this spring patched up in a couple of hours
 how- with what? 12
  there's nothing out here but rattlesnakes
 now ain't it the truth? 10
  lord laughed with secret amusement
 not a danged thing but rattlesnakes so i reckon i'll get the boss rattler to help me
 tom! for god's sake! looky
 he pointed cutting her off
 see that wildcat? 15
    she saw it then the distant derrick of the wildcat- a test well in unexplored country
 and even with her limited knowledge of such things she knew that the car could be repaired there; sufficiently at least to get them back into town
 a wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency 9
 he had to depend on himself since he was invariably miles and hours away from others
 well let's get going she said impatiently
 i- she broke off frowning
 what did you mean by that rattlesnake gag? 9
  getting the boss rattlesnake to help you? 10
    why i meant what i said lord declared
 what else would i mean anyways? 14
    she looked at him lips compressed
 then with a shrug of pretended indifference she took a compact from her purse and went through the motions of fixing her make-up 7
 in his mood it was the best way to handle him; that is to show no curiosity whatsoever
 otherwise she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked until she lost control of herself and thus lost still another battle in the maddening struggle of tom lord vs joyce lakewood 6
 the car lurched along at a snail's crawl the left-front mudguard banging and scraping against the tire occasionally scraping against the road itself
 lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel 8
 he seemed very pleased with himself as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned
 along with this self-satisfaction however joyce sensed a growing tension
 it poured out of him like an electric current a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action and that that action would be all that he anticipated
 joyce had seen him like this once before- more than once actually but on one particularly memorable occasion
 that was the day that he had practically mopped up the main street of big sands with aaron mcbride field boss for the highlands oil + gas company
 tom had been laying for aaron mcbride for a long time just waiting to catch him out of line
 mcbride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with a pistol on his hip
 he had a legitimate reason for wearing it
 it was payday for highlands and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields
 moreover as long as the weapon was carried openly the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it
 so what's this all about? 9
  he demanded when lord confronted him
 i'm not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without a permit
 it was the wrong thing to say
 by failing to do as he was told instantly- to take out a permit or return the gun to his car- he had played into lord's hands 5
 the trouble was that he had virtually had to protest 11
 the deputy had forced him to by his manner of accosting him 7
 so how about it? 15
  he said
 why single me out on this permit deal? 10
    well i'll tell you about that lord told him
 we aim t' be see-lective y'know? 15
  don't like to bother no one unless we have to which i figger we do in your case
 figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you highlands big shots
 he himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company but that had nothing to do with him
 he was an honest man doing a hard job and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable
 look lord he said hoarsely
 i know you've got a grudge against me and maybe i can't blame you
 you think that highlands swindled you and i helped 'em do it 8
 but you're all wrong man! i'm no lawyer
 i just do what i'm told and- uh-huh
 an' that could mean trouble with a fella that's workin' for crooks
 so you get rid of that pistol right now mis-ter mcbride 9
 you do that or take you out a permit right now 10
 mcbride couldn't do either of course
 not immediately as the deputy demanded
 not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minutes 9
 to do so would make his job well-nigh impossible 17
 oil-field workers were a rough-tough lot
 how could he exert authority over them- make them toe the line as he had to- if he knuckled under to this small-town clown? 8
    i'll get around to it a little later he mumbled desperately
 just as soon as i go to the bank and-   huh-uh 18
 now mis-ter mcbride said lord and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm
 it was strictly the deputy's game but mcbride had gone too far to throw in
 now he could only play the last card in what was probably the world's coldest deck
 he flung off lord's hand and attempted to push past him inadvertently shoving him into a storefront
 it was practically the last move that mcbride made of his own volition
 lord slugged him in the stomach so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine
 then as he doubled gasping vomiting the breakfast he had s o lately eaten lord straightened him with an uppercut
 a rabbit punch redoubled him
 and then there was a numbing blow to the heart and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach h   but he couldn't keep up with them 6
 no more could he defend himself against them
 he seemed to be fighting not one man but a dozen 13
 and he could no longer think of face-saving of honor but only of escape
 why he's going to kill me he thought wildly
 i meant him no harm
 i've given willful hurt to no man
 i was just doing my job just following orders and for that he's going to kill me
 beat me to death in front of a hundred people 9
 somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was about to die was the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for it: the murder would go unpunished
 he mcbride would be cited as in the wrong and he lord would go scot-free an officer who had only done his duty though perhaps too energetically
 mcbride staggered into the street flopped sprawling in the stinging dust
 fear-maddened fleeing the lengthening shadow of death he scrambled to his feet again
 he couldn't see; he was long past the point of coherent thinking
 dimly he heard laughter hoots of derision but he could not read the racket properly
 he could not grasp that lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air
 he hated them too much to understand- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was lord's world
 this he was sure was the way they would act; laughing at a dying man laughing as a man was beaten to death
 and nothing would be done about it
 nothing unless h   donna! donna his young wife the girl who was both daughter and wife to him
 donna was like he was
 she lived by the rules never compromising never blinded or diverted by circumstance
 and donna would- when he regained consciousness he was in lord's house in the office of doctor lord the deputy's deceased father 6
 the brannon outfit- known as the slash-b because of its brand- reached hondo creek before sundown
 the herd was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's bedground
 two of the new hands a mexican named jose amado and a kid known only as laredo were picked for the first trick of riding night herd 8
 the rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and turned them into the remuda
 they got tin cups of coffee from the big pot on the coosie's fire rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes lounged about 7
 there was some idle talk a listless discussion of this or that small happening during the day's drive
 but they deliberately avoided the one subject that had them all curious: the failure of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit 8
 it especially bothered the older hands
 the cook mateo garcia had arrived there long before the herd 9
 he'd started a fire and put coffee on and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon
 he was readying a batch of sourdough biscuits for the dutch oven 11
 supper would be ready within the hour
 the maguire family was setting up a separate camp nearby 10
 billie had unhitched the mules from both tom brannon's and his father's wagon
 hank had gathered wood for a cookfire and his wife was busy at it now
 conchita kept an eye on the twins and little elena trying to keep them from falling into the creek by which they persisted in playing
 conchita nagged at the younger children attempting without success to keep her thoughts off tom brannon
 tom brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after the maguires joined it which had been at midday
 he'd come alone without his wife and child
 he'd been in an angry mood: conchita had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him
 she wondered what had taken place in town between him and his wife
 she wished that she could talk to her mother about it 6
 not that her mother knew what had happened but they could speculate upon it
 but her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it and say that it was none of her concern
 pat get out of that creek! you too sean! elena you'll get mud all over your dress!   even as she called to the children conchita let her gaze seek tom brannon
 tomas she called him- as the mexican hands did
 he was in earnest conversation with her father and the old vaquero luis hernandez
 whatever they are talking about? 10
  conchita wondered
 it bothered her that she probably would never know 6
 certainly she wouldn't dare ask her father afterward 10
 he would tell her not to pry into grownups' affairs- as though she were a little kid like elena! at the moment the three men were not saying much of anything
 they were sitting on their heels rider-fashion over by the still empty calf wagon
 brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to the left rear wheel with the other two facing him
 he held a cigarette in his right hand
 it was burning away forgotten
 his face was clouded with unhappiness
 he'd told hank maguire and luis hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what he now intended to do 5
 they were considering it gravely neither seeming to like what he planned
 finally hernandez said i could offer you advice tomas but you wouldn't heed it
 wait a little while
 let senora brannon live in her father's house for a time 8
 give her time to miss you
 maybe she will then come to you
 after all you want the senora as much as you want the boy 12
 you need her even more than you need him
 she won't change her mind brannon said
 john clayton will see to that
 but after a time away from you h
 a year luis? 20
  five? 19
  ten? 15
  how long should i wait? 11
  maybe in a year tomas h
 in a year she'll like living in clayton's house too much to come back to me brannon said flatly
 and the boy will be too much under his influence by then 8
 i've got to take danny away from clayton before i lose him altogether
 hell in a year or five or t en the boy will have forgotten me- his own father!   but to take him and leave his mother behind is not good
 in my place you'd follow such advice as you give me? 7
    hernandez looked suddenly uncertain
 that i can't answer for i can't imagine something like this happening to me
 maybe i should withdraw my advice- no? 9
    brannon looked at hank maguire
 and you? 20
  what would you do in my place? 13
    hank shook his head
 like luis i can't see something like this happening to me 9
 with maria and me there's never any problem
 where i go she goes- and the kids with us
 you're going to need your woman
 and the boy will need his mother
 if you take the one you'd better take both 12
 i won't force beth to come against her will
 but i'm going to have my son
 they were silent for a little while each looking glum 11
 finally luis hernandez said what must be must be 7
 i am with you of course tomas
 and hank maguire added so am i tom
 all right brannon said rising
 we'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck
 brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall 10
 they had for cover both darkness and a summer storm 6
 during much of the fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the sky to the east
 later they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then just outside rockfork they ran into rain
 those who had slickers donned them
 the others put on old coats or ducking jackets whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles
 there were seven of them enough for a show of strength- to run a bluff
 it was to be nothing more than that
 there was to be no gunplay
 if the bluff failed and they ran into trouble brannon had told the others they would withdraw- and he would come after his son another time
 he didn't want to put himself outside the law
 with him were hank maguire luis hernandez and luis's son pedro 7
 the ramirez brothers were also along
 the seventh man was red hogan a wiry little puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising
 they were all good men
 it was dark early because of the storm
 also because of the storm the streets of rockfork were deserted 8
 lighted windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour 7
 they reined in before the town marshal's office a box-sized building on main street
 a lamp burned inside but brannon peering through the window saw that the office was empty
 he'd hoped to catch jesse macklin there
 probably just stepped out he said
 red come along
 the rest of you wait here
 with red hogan he rode to the welcome cafe
 hogan got down from the saddle and had a look inside 6
 not there he said getting back onto his horse 10
 maybe he's at the hotel
 they rode to the rockfork house a little farther along the opposite side of the street
 they reined in there brannon remaining in the saddle while hogan went to look for jesse macklin in the hotel dining room
 he'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and it was already soaked 7
 but he felt no physical discomfort
 he was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain 13
 he hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder
 hogan reappeared stopped on the hotel porch lifted a hand in signal
 brannon dismounted and climbed the steps
 he's finished eating hogan said
 sitting with a cup of coffee now
 it seemed long at least to tom brannon
 he and hogan waited by the door one to either side 6
 macklin was the third man to come out and he came unhurriedly 8
 he was puffing on a cigar and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain
 it was not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them and then it was too late
 they closed in fast kept him from reaching inside his coat for his gun
 just come along brannon told him
 don't start anything you can't finish
 we'll talk over at your office
 brannon i warn you! let's go marsh al brannon said and took him by the arm
 hogan gripped the lawman's other arm
 they escorted him down from the porch and through the rain to his office
 the other five slash-b men followed them inside crowding the small room
 his face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms 7
 he looked at each of them in turn brannon last of all 11
 i'll remember you he said
 every last one of you
 as for you brannon-   put your gun on the desk marshal 9
 now hold on damn it; i won't- red hogan's patience ran out 8
 he lifted the skirt of macklin's coat took his gun from its holster tossed it onto the desk
 too much fooling around he said
 don't press your luck badge-toter
 brannon said now the key to the lockup marshal 14
 what for? 20
  can't you guess? 13
  brannon said
 we're putting you where you won't come to harm
 get it out!   damned if i will
 brannon you've assaulted a law officer and-   they moved in on him crowded him from all sides
 no man laid a hand on him but the threat of violence was there
 his face took on a sudden pallor became beaded with sweat and he seemed to have trouble with his breathing
 he held out a moment longer then his nerve gave under the pressure
 he swore and said all right
 it's here in my pocket
 get it out brannon ordered
 then as macklin obeyed: now let's go out back 8
 resignedly macklin turned to the back door
 they followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear
 the door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded with strap iron
 it was secured by an oversized padlock
 macklin balked again not wanting to unlock and open the door 9
 they crowded him in that threatening way once more forced him to give in
 once the door was open they crowded him inside the dark building 9
 he was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door
 they returned to the street mounted their horses rode through the rain to the big house on houston street
 its windows glowed with lamplight
 deputy marshal luke harper still stood guard on the veranda a forlorn scarecrowish figure in the murky dark
 he came to the edge of the veranda peered down at them with his hand on his gun
 don't try it brannon told him dismounting and starting up the steps with his men following
 don't get yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you 3
 he strode past the now frightened man entered the house 10
 miguel and arturo ramirez remained on the veranda to keep harper from interfering
 the others followed brannon inside
 they trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house
 they brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves that of their own sweat of campfire smoke of horses and cattle
 they tracked mud on the oaken floor on the carpet 8
 their presence fouled the elegance of that room 10
 and their arrival caught john clayton and charles ansley off guard
 the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing 15
 for men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had received no second
 but the day of the deadline came and passed and the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction
 for with a single exception nothing had happened to them 6
 the exception was an iron mountain settler named william lewis 8
 after walking out to his corral that morning he'd been amazed to see the dust puff up in front of his feet
 a split second later the distant crack of a rifle had sounded 8
 he'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the shot had come
 but he had found all of the thickets and points of cover deserted
 there had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or trace to show that anyone had been near
 lewis was a man who had made a full-time job of cow stealing 10
 he hadn't even pretended to be farming his spre ad 9
 his land had never been plowed
 he had done his rustling openly and boasted about it 10
 he had received both first and second anonymous notices and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them
 he had cursed at them and threatened them
 he was a man those neighbors testified later who didn't have a friend in the world
 william lewis made the rounds of all who lived near him again that august morning after a bullet landed at his feet and once more he accused and threatened everyone
 i'll be ready next time! he raged
 i'll be shootin' right back
 he had his chance the very next morning for exactly the same thing happened again
 this time lewis had his own rifle in his hands and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot then spent most of the day searching out the area
 he found nothing but he still refused to give up and move out 11
 just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face- to-face! he exploded
 that's all i ask!   he never got that chance
 for the unseen ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the third time
 30-30 bullet smashed directly into the center of william lewis' chest
 he slumped against a log fence rail then tried to lift himself 7
 two more shots followed in quick succession dropping him limp and huddled on the ground
 an inquest was held and after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes the county coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 300 yards
 rumors of the offer tom horn had made at the stockgrowers' association meeting had leaked out by then and as a grand jury investigation of the murder got underway the prosecuting attorney a colonel baird ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for questioning
 it took some time to locate horn
 he was finally found in the bates hole region of natrona county two counties away
 prosecutor baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting and began preparing an indictment
 but that indictment was never made
 for tom horn it turned out had a number of rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight faces that he had been in bates hole the day of the killing
 the former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken
 the authorities had to release him
 he immediately rode on to cheyenne threw a ten-day drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends 7
 dead center at three hundred yards that coroner said! he'd grin 6
 three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground! you reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that? 6
  publicly he denied everything
 privately he created and magnified an image of himself as a hired assassin
 for a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for the job he'd promised to do
 tom horn was soon back at work giving his secret employers their money's worth
 a good many beef-hungry settlers were accepting the death of william lewis as proof that the warning notes were not idle threats 6
 the company herds were being raided less often and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted
 but there were other homesteaders who passed the lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing the work of one of his neighbors 9
 the rustling problem was by no means solved 12
 even in the very area where the shooting had been done cattle were still disappearing
 for less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his existence might be foreclosed on- a blatant and defiant rustler named fred powell
 fred was mighty crude about the way he took in cattle his own hired man andy ross mentioned later
 everyone knew it but he sort of acted like he didn't care who knew it- even after them notes came even after he'd heard about lewis even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself! on the morning of september 10 1895 powell and ross rose at dawn and began their day's work
 haying time was close at hand and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack
 harnessing a team to a buckboard they drove out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off then climbed down and began chopping 6
 andy ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sounded
 he looked around in surprise then noticed that fred powell was clutching his chest
 the hired man ran over to help his boss
 my god i'm shot! powell gasped
 and he collapsed and died instantly
 ross had no intention of searching for the assassin 9
 he heaved the dead man onto the buckboard yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast
 but he brought back the sheriff and several deputies and to the lawmen the entire affair seemed a repetition of the lewis killing 9
 a detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place 6
 there were no tracks of either hoofs or boots 8
 not even an empty cartridge case could be found 8
 once again tom horn was the first and most likely suspect and he was brought in for questioning immediately
 once again he shook his head kept his face expressionless and his voice very calm and had a strongly supported alibi ready 6
 later riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies of cheyenne he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations he made
 exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business proposition with me he'd blandly announce
 and i sort o' got a corner on the market
 tom a friend asked him once how come you bushwhacked them rustlers? 6
  they wouldn't o' stood no chance with you in a plain straight-out shoot-down
 he had lots of friends then as always
 even as he became widely known as a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend 7
 no man's name brought more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo 9
 well he explained s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope? 9
  which would you be most scairt of- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down? 6
  yeah i can see that the friend was forced to agree 11
 but h well it just don't seem sportin' somehow! sportin'! the tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared in amazement
 sportin'! he echoed again in soft wonder
 i seen a lot o' things in my time
 i found a trooper once the apache had spread-eagled on an ant hill and another time we ran across some teamsters they'd caught tied upside down on their own wagon wheels over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' their skulls
 i heard o' texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to death 5
 but there's one thing i never seen or heard of one thing i just don't think there is and that's a sportin' way o' killin' a man!   after the first two murders the warning notes were rarely ignored
 the lesson had been learned
 when fred powell's brother- in-law charlie keane moved into the dead man's home the anonymous letter writer took no chances on charlie taking up where fred had left off and wasted no time on a firs t notice:   if you don't leave this country within 3 days your life will be taken the same as powell's was
 this was the message found tacked to the cabin door 10
 keane left within three days
 all through albany and laramie counties other men were doing the same
 houses of settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource free for the taking were sitting empty with weeds growing high in their yards
 the small half-heartedly tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow
 no cow thief could count on a jury of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer
 jury judge and executioner were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient brand of justice the men of the new west had believed long outdated
 for three straight years tom horn patrolled the southern wyoming pastures and how many men he killed after lewis and powell will never be known
 it is possible although highly doubtful that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder in the state
 it is also possible but equally doubtful that he actually shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him 11
 for that legend was growing explosively rumor was insisting he received a price of $600 a man
 a monthly wage of about $125 very good money in an era when top rumor had it he slipped two small rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark
 one thing was certain- his method was effective so effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary 6
 the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week
 my reputation's my stock in trade tom mentioned more than once 7
 he evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall in the end
 he had made himself the personification of the devil to the homesteaders
 but to the cattlemen who had been facing bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced with lay-offs a few years earlier he was becoming a vastly different type of legendary figure
 such ranchers as coble and clay and the bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown
 he made their spreads his headquarters and he helped out in their roundups
 in the cow camps tom horn was regarded as a hero as the same kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos
 the hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that w as threatening a beloved way of life
 the wailing guitar-strumming minstrels of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him
 by 1898 rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in wyoming
 when several minutes had passed and curt hadn't emerged from the livery stable brenner reentered the hotel and faced summers across the counter
 i have a little job for you charlie
 i'm sure you won't mind doing me a small favor 6
 brenner's voice was oily but summers wasn't fooled 9
 he moistened his lips uneasily
 what is it you want me to do mr brenner? 13
  brenner shrugged carelessly
 i just want you to take a message to diane molinari 13
 tell her to come here to the hotel
 vastly relieved summers nodded and started toward the door 8
 one thing summers brenner said
 you're not to mention my name
 tell her curt adams wants to see her
 summers pulled up short and turned around
 i don't know mr brenner he said haltingly beginning to get an inkling of brenner's plans
 it doesn't seem quite right telling her a thing like that 8
 couldn't i just- his voice trailed off into silence 6
 brenner continued to smile but his eyes were cold 9
 he turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed
 you know summers he said thoughtfully
 eagle's nest ought to have a fire company
 if someone were to drop a match in here this place would go up like a haystack
 he started toward the stairway then turned to add tell her to come to adams's room that adams is in trouble
 yes sir
 his face pale summers headed for the street
 curt's visit to the livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching
 he paused only long enough to ascertain that jess's buckskin was still missing and that his own gray was all right then climbed through a back window and dropped to the ground outside 5
 the fact that jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate that diane's information had been wrong but curt didn't interpret it this way
 a man like jess would want to have a ready means of escape in case it was needed
 probably his horse would be close to where he was hiding 10
 from the back of the barn it was a simple matter to reach black's house without using the street
 curt approached the place cautiously and watched it several minutes from the protection of a grove of trees
 there was a light in black's front room but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior
 curt circled the house and located a barn out back 8
 he could hear horses moving around inside and nothing else 9
 there was no lock on the door only an iron hook which he unfastened
 he opened the door and went in pulling it shut behind him 7
 again he stood in the darkness listening but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank floor
 he moved ahead carefully his left hand in front of him and came to a wooden partition
 horse smell was very strong and he could hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws
 he found a match in his pocket and lit it
 there were two horses in the barn a sway-backed dun and jess crouch's buckskin
 curt snuffed out the match
 it was certain now that jess was in the house but also presumably was stacey black
 curt wanted to get jess alone without interference from anyone even as spineless a person as the store owner
 he studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved
 reaching across the side of the stall he slapped the buckskin on the rump
 the startled animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall
 as curt had hoped the house door banged open
 he slapped the buckskin again and it kicked wildly its hoofs rattling the side of the stall
 curt moved over beside the door and waited
 presently he heard footsteps crossing the yard and jess's smothered curses
 the door swung open and jess said sourly what the hell's the matter with you? 6
    the horse continued to snort
 curt doubted that any animal belonging to jess would find much reassurance in its owner's voice
 jess cursed again and entered the barn
 a match flared and he reached above his head to light a lantern which hung from a wire loop
 as he crossed to the side of the stall curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer
 before you try anything he said
 remember what happened to gruller
 jess caught his breath in surprise
 he started to reach for his gun but apparently thought better of it
 that's the stuff curt said
 just hold it that way
 he reached out to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt
 you and i have a little talking to do jess
 you won't be needing this
 he moved up and lifted jess's pistol out of its holster 10
 damn you adams- jess was beginning to recover from his initial shock
 we ain't got nothing to talk about
 if i don't come back in the house breed's going to-   your trigger-happy brother isn't in the house
 about now he's probably having supper
 that long ride the four of you took must've given him a good appetite
 now turn around so i can see your face
 there was raw fury in his eyes and the veins of his neck were swollen
 you're about as dumb as they come adams
 i don't know what you're up to but when brenner- you can forget about brenner too curt said
 it's ben arbuckle we're going to talk about
 i don't know nothin' about him
 no? 19
  i suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two- by-four either; one with blood all over it arbuckle's blood 6
 curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun
 so help me crouch i'd like to kill you where you stand but before i do i'm going to hear you admit killing him 5
 who told you to do it? 12
  was it dutch brenner? 15
  curt was holding jess's gun in his left hand 8
 he drew back his arm to slash the gunbarrel across jess's face but didn't finish the motion
 pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone like jess but curt couldn't bring himself to do it
 apparently sensing this and realizing that it gave him an advantage jess became bold
 having all the guns makes you a big man don't it adams? 8
  if we was both armed you wouldn't talk so tough
 no? 19
  curt reached out and dropped jess's pistol back into the holster 6
 he retreated a step and holstered his own
 all right crouch; we're on even terms
 now draw! sweat bubbled out on jess's swarthy face 10
 the fingers of his right hand twisted into a claw but he didn't reach for the gun
 curt angry enough to be a little reckless raised his hands shoulder high
 does this make it any easier coward? 11
  i ain't drawin' against you jess said thickly 8
 i heard how you outdrew chico
 you're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind and hits him with a club
 i just wanted to hear you say so
 jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his sides
 he had found curt's weakness or what to jess was a weakness and was smart enough to take advantage of it
 somewhere in the distance a woman screamed 12
 curt was too involved in his own problems to pay much attention 6
 he had to make jess talk and he had to do it before stacey black got curious and came to investigate
 once more he lifted jess's gun from its holster only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin 5
 he dropped his own beside it
 we'll do it another way then he said harshly
 jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which was smashed out of shape by curt's fist
 with a roar of pain and fury jess made his attack 8
 curt managed to duck beneath the man's flailing fist and drove home a solid left to jess's mid-section
 it was like hitting a sack of salt
 pain shout up curt's arm clear to the shoulder but jess seemed hardly aware that he had been hit
 he slammed into the wall bounced back and caught curt with a roundhouse right which sent him spinning
 an inch lower and it would have knocked him out
 as it was his vision blurred and for a moment he was unable to move
 when his eyes began to focus he saw jess charging at him with a pitchfork
 curt twisted to one side and the tines of the fork bit into the floor
 jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose 8
 it gave curt time to stagger to his feet
 the tines broke off under jess's twisting and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock curt's brains out
 his aim was hurried; so the pitchfork whistled over curt's head
 by now curt was seeing clearly again
 he stepped inside jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly putting everything he had behind them
 they made jess double over
 when his head came down curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the wall
 the building shook setting the lantern to swaying and the buckskin to pitching again
 even black's old crowbait began to snort and from the house black yelled jess! what's going on out there? 7
    jess didn't seem too sure himself
 he lurched drunkenly to his feet lowered his head and took one step away from the wall
 curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which started at the floor
 blood gushed from his nose and he backed off as rapidly as he could stumbling over his own feet in his frantic haste to get away from curt's fists
 curt was in almost as bad shape but he wouldn't quit 7
 he backed jess into a corner grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront and drew back his right fist
 tell me about arbuckle! you killed him didn't you? 8
    it was brenner's idea jess mumbled dabbing at his nose 11
 he found out about you and arbuckle talking 13
 he wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble
 you mean anyone who stood up for his rights curt said 10
 he let go of the shirt and jess slumped to the floor 7
 turning his back curt crossed to the stall reached over to untie the buckskin's halter rope and waved his hand in the animal's face
 the buckskin bolted out of the stall
 curt moved in and picked up his gun
 he shook loose straw out of the action and placed the gun in his holster
 leaving jess's where it lay he left the stall 9
 we're going someplace
 jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the door 8
 who's in there? 10
  black called fearfully
 curt opened the door grabbed black by the shoulder and pulled him into the barn
 you're staying right here for a while
 this dirty coward just admitted killing arbuckle
 i'm going to let him tell it to somebody else 5
 he shoved black toward the stall and pointed his pistol at jess 7
 you're coming along peacefully or i'll put a bullet in your leg
 jess stumbled through the door
 curt followed reaching behind him to shut the door and hook it
 black would have little trouble getting out but it might delay him a few minutes
 where're you takin' me? 13
  jess asked worriedly
 we're going to marshal woods's house
 maybe if the marshal hears this himself it'll make a difference
 somebody in this town must still have some backbone 9
 over his shoulder he could see max's loose grin and the burnsides' glowering faces
 soon as we send them on their way and make camp let's you and me go for a walk down by the snake- all by ourselves
 sally admonished her mother you've got all evening to visit with dan
 his wounds need dressing now
 mrs jackson's words recalled dan to his lack of fitness for courting
 what a spectacle he was caked with dirt and sweat and blood filthy as a pig and naked as an indian kissing the finest the sweetest the bravest and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world
 he released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with old hap
 got a lot to tend to but i'll get back quick as i can he assured her
 dan could hear clayton burnside and eben jackson summing up their final reckoning for rental on the oxen
 jackson was doing most of the talking
 so long as sally's pa was coming out best on the haggle dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits' worth
 soon as the burnsides moved on he'd lead rex down by the river; there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening 7
 damn it he thought bitterly picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh bullet hole in the sleeve
 if i hadn't got nate stopped when i did my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell!   he stooped picked up his ruined hat and pursed his lips thoughtfully
 from the way the wound in his head was itching dan knew that it would heal
 but his only hat was something else again 14
 the burnsides now ready to roll were purposefully deaf to his cry
 nate! he bellowed to the retreating back directly in front of him 7
 i ain't going to fight you no more
 nate turned his head attempting to speak in a soothing voice 7
 i know you ain't! dan affirmed feeling ten feet tall 9
 he moved in close jerked the handsome broad-brimmed beaver hat from nate's head and clamped it on his own
 here's a present for you he said shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over nate's purpling forehead
 me and you's trading hats so's you'll have something permanent to remember me by!   sally left her choring to stand beside dan 6
 slipping her hand in his they silently watched the burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight
 much as they had to look forward to they didn't begrudge a moment of the time they spent seeing them go
 at first matilda could not believe her own eyes 10
 she had spent too many hours looking ahead hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of dan and finding nothing but emptiness 7
 and now she could see him looking uncommon handsome standing there beside sally jackson and her folks in front of their trail-worn wagon
 seeing them waiting there at the foot of emigrant rock was so overwhelming that for a good minute after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward them matilda could not speak at all
 then with a glory that almost wiped out the deep downward sags in her careworn face matilda leaned over the wheel and shouted to hez who was stumbling along in the heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon pa! pa! i can see dan
 and he's with the jacksons!   what about burnsides? 11
  hez asked who still believed they'd have them to lick 6
 they ain't even in sight! she replied
 by then hez could see for himself and so could the others 7
 soon they were all shouting greetings exchanging smiles and rejoicing to think that they were all back together again 8
 but even a reunion as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day
 nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until they made circle tended the cattle tethered the horses gathered fuel carried water and started their cooking fires
 then and only then with the jacksons and dan as their true guests of honor did the harrows take time to catch up on the news 5
 no sooner did they hear of dan's injury than both gran and matilda went into immediate action
 the wound in his scalp was examined pronounced healing and well doctored with simples before they dished up the victuals 5
 from then on in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood the whole group settled down to relish their food 7
 even sally in spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome followed the old taboo of quitting the gab when wearing the nosebag 5
 after their supper the evening turned into a regular hoe-down 10
 only they carefully substituted old country folk dances for the virginia reels and square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the great westward migration
 but with bill o'connor on the fiddle and gran harrow exuberantly shouting glory be and hallelujah above their united chant of the lilting old ballads they played their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real celebration
 golly rod exclaimed to harmony as he dutifully stood by her side among the ringed spectators don't that fiddle make you wish the bible didn't say us baptists can't dance? 4
  nor methodists neither she replied
 not that it matters to me being this far along
 rod gave her a warm pat on the shoulder before he replied 8
 come spring you'll be kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too gal
 at these words of sympathy and understanding harmony said generously i don't mind setting here along with gran while you go out and join in the games
 rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling group out in the circle long enough to reply i ain't much of a hand for dare-base and farmer-in-the-dell but i'd sure like to get in on the handhold and wrestles
 he looked down at his big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers 9
 don't reckon there's nobody out there 'cept maybe dan who can outgrip me harmony
 with rod on his way and matilda visiting with mrs jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff harmony settled on the edge of the grub box to ease the pressure of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs and worried about all that might have happened to sally
 and she was deeply thankful that she could see her now out there in the midst of a gay youthful circle skipping and singing farmer in the dell farmer in the dell heigh- ho the dairy-oh the farmer in the dell
 at the sight of sally's happy face and carefree expression harmony's dark brooding eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears 8
 she was glad completely and unselfishly glad to see that things were working out the right way for both sally and dan
 h and she really tried to go a step further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were for her and for rod 7
 but she couldn't not yet
 not with the memory of her folks and the lost conestoga still holding her close h
 out in the center of the circle the farmer who was dan wasted no time when they came to the line the farmer choose his wife 9
 with a swift swoop of his big arms he grabbed sally out of the circle surrounding him and then kissed her soundly before setting her down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest of their outfit
 soon the child the dog the cat h and even the cheese all joined them out there in the circle
 by now harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and resting or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure of the great cliff towering above them
 no matter how many registry rocks they came to on this journey each one exerted its own appeal
 even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization when stumbled across out here in this wilderness 8
 already a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at the register rocks leaving their own records along with those made by the earlier trains
 soon she saw rod and hez moving over to join them 8
 no sooner were they through and the guards posted than the whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep
 for matilda it was the first she had known in many a night 8
 even the knowledge that she was losing another boy as a mother always does when a marriage is made did not prevent her from having the first carefree dreamless sleep that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into bear valley way way back there when they were crossing those other mountains
 next morning they moved on again
 my souls' a-gracious! gran harrow exclaimed watching their rippling muscles as rod and dan swung her up into the load 5
 a body would swear i floated right up here on a cloud!   rod and dan released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged embarrassed grins
 shucks gran they said almost in unison
 that wasn't nothing at all!   leaning forward in her chair gran nearsightedly scrutinized dan's face
 how's sally like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising? 6
  quit ragging him gran rod protested
 i ain't ragging him! gran peered again at the week-old blond mustache shadowing dan's upper lip
 but honest- to-betsy i've seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon
 the two tall brothers waited silently while their mother handed gran her cold snack and water jug placed the chamber pot beside her feet and returned to her place at the front of the wagon with alice 5
 rheumatics worse pa? 15
  dan asked hez who had limped back from his team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends
 my right leg's stiff as a board this morning he replied
 but the sun'll fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling 8
 the three men stepped out to the side to wait for captain clemens' signal
 hez looked up at the high face of emigrant rock official signboard for the raft river turnoff and gloated seems funny that them burnsides never took time to leave their john-henry up thar 4
 wonder what made them hurry so rod drawled giving dan a sly wink 7
 dan grinned and changed the subject
 from now on sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it comes up and fall in behind you and rod's outfit 7
 ain't no sense you eating our dust rod protested 6
 sally and her ma want to trade off on account of harmony being so far along dan explained
 jackson recruited his critters and him and me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up
 he's got the tightest running gear in the train now 8
 besides 'tain't no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen so's i can unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch 5
 captain clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting teams
 reckon ye're right dan hez called back over his shoulder 6
 i'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' the canyon 5
 rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing precipice-walled gorge
 we'll double teams zigzagging up the mountain harmony he spoke reassuringly concerned by the pinched look around her mouth 5
 like enough we'll all be up on top by sundown
 out of the corner of his eye he could see his father's wheels beginning to turn
 before harmony had a chance to reply rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs h
 while no larger than dutch springs this mining supply town had the appearance of being far busier and more prosperous 7
 men crowded the streets and freight rigs and teams were moving about
 although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch this activity enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid them
 gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's here at all cobb declared glancing along the street as they stretched their legs 4
 there were no less than six or seven saloons in ganado not counting the lower class dives all vying for the trade of celebrating miners and teamsters
 take one side of the street and i'll take the other he propose d 7
 if you spot carmer give a yell before you move in 9
 you do the same
 it's all i ask stevens
 separating they took different sides of the main drag and systematically combed the bars
 russ visited two places without result and his blood pressure was down to zero
 suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate gyp carmer so casually even were he to prove the thief
 he tramped out of the miners rest with his hopes plummeting and headed doggedly for the palace saloon the last place of any consequence on this side of the street
 the palace was an elaborate establishment built practically on stilts in front with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch
 behind its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest to the rocky ribs of the canyonside
 russ ran up the steps quickly to the plank porch
 the front windows of the place were long and narrow reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of the interior
 heading for the batwings cobb glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window and suddenly dodged aside
 nerves tight as a bowstring he paused to gather his wits 8
 against all expectation carmer was inside clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him
 fierce anger surged through russ
 he fought down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot
 reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows he feverishly scanned the busy street below
 stevens was nowhere in sight
 muffling an exclamation russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran down
 as luck had it he had not gone twenty feet in the street before pat appeared
 what luck cobb? 20
  he said swiftly
 he's there he got out tersely curbing his rising excitement 5
 hitching his cartridge belt around pat glanced upward briefly at the palace and started that way with cobb at his side 5
 climbing the steps steadily they reached the top and headed for the door
 forced behind him momentarily russ followed at once and halted two steps inside
 while five minutes ago the place had presented a scene of easy revelry with gyp carmer a prominent figure it was now as somnolent and dull as the day before payday
 carmer himself was nowhere to be seen
 a man knocked the roulette ball about idly in its track and another dozed at one of the card tables
 two men murmured with their heads together at the end of the bar while the sleek-headed bartender absently polished a glass
 looking the setup over stevens started coolly for the rear of the place
 where yuh goin'? 17
    it was the barkeep
 halting pat turned to survey him deliberately
 he did not reply going on toward the back
 less assured than the tall wide-shouldered man in the lead cobb followed alertly a hand on his gun butt
 the bartender measured this situation with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it
 a hall opened in back of the bar running toward an ell
 small rooms probably for cards opened off on either side 9
 all the doors were open at this hour except one and it was toward this that stevens made his way with russ close at his shoulder
 a single kick made it spring open shuddering 10
 pat saw gyp carmer staggering forward a half-filled bottle upraised as if to strike
 russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside
 with a bellow carmer lunged at him
 but he was more than half-drunk and his faculties were dulled 17
 cobb unleashed a single powerful jab that sent gyp reeling wildl y and crashing down with a whining groan
 he started to struggle up heaving desperately
 russ gave him a brutal thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach
 kneeling cobb planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back holding him pinned
 i've drawn his fangs he snapped
 go through his pockets will you? 10
  if we have to we'll take him apart and see what he's made of!   complying methodically pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing
 cobb watched this with hunted eyes his desperate hope waning by the moment
 stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when russ abruptly rose and lunged toward carmer's hat which had tumbled half-a-dozen feet away when he first fell
 straightening up his eyes ablaze he held out the battered stetson 8
 look at this!   inside the crown stuffed behind the stained sweatband could be seen thin crumpled wads of currency 6
 carmer's ingenious cache for his loot had been found 8
 by golly stevens! you were right russ exclaimed tearing the loose bills out of carmer's hat
 that is if we can be sure this is colcord's money-   pat grunted 12
 where else would he get it? 9
  count what you've got there cob b
 russ ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher would come by honestly
 it's within a hundred of what crip had he declared 3
 we know penny spent some- and carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on
 handing the money over russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs as if ridding himself of something unclean
 his glance at gyp carmer was disdainful
 shall we get out of here? 12
    leaving the card room they moved back through the palace the way they had come
 glowering looks met them in the bar but there was no attempt to halt them
 pausing in the outside door to glance behind him pat looked his unspoken warning and stepped out
 he and cobb clattered down the high steps to the street 11
 neither spoke till they reached their horses
 pat paused there looking across at the young fellow 8
 it'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to colcord and tell him about it russ
 he started to return it
 to his faint surprise russ held up his hand
 not me he ruled decidedly
 it was you that tracked it down anyway stevens he pursued strictly
 whatever you say
 pat swung into the saddle yet still he delayed his brows puckered
 you owe it to penny to give her a chance to explain that she was defending you really he observed mildly
 old crip wasn't retorted cobb tartly
 he'll know when you tell him
 but i want this to sink in awhile
 then maybe next time he won't be so quick on the trigger 8
 pat had never pretended to give advice in such affairs 6
 you're the doctor he returned with a smile
 but i still think penny's an awful nice girl russ-   you don't have to tell me flashed cobb
 giving the other a dark look he hauled his bronc around and trotted down off the street
 pat let him go following more leisurely
 at the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner and as a consequence did not see cobb strike the open range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells for antler 8
 the truth was the puncher was both bewildered and dismayed b y his own mixed luck
 penny's always glad to see me over there he mused bleakly 8
 yet had he not visited the girl at saw buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle
 over and above that however was his growing suspicion of chuck stober's part in recent events
 gyp carmer couldn't have known about colcord's money unless he was told- and who else would have told him? 5
  he asked himself
 it's the second time war ax hands made a play for that money 2
 how much of an accident could that be? 15
    nearing home he jerked to attention at the distant crack of a gun
 in town no one paid much attention to an occasional shot; but on the range gunfire had a meaning
 hauling up russ listened carefully
 two minutes later it came again- a double explosion followed by a third sounding more distant
 as near as cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the antler ranch house
 he tightened up in a twinkling
 so far as he knew only his father could be there 11
 what did it mean? 18
  clapping spurs to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter with growing alarm
 his first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells told him nothing
 still a quarter-mile away the fresh clap of guns only served to increase his speed
 setting a course straight for the house he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his face
 when it was followed by a second whining even closer cobb swerved sharply aside into a depression
 he knew now what he was up against
 whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging the antler house and having spotted his approach was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight 5
 cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in his saddle boot russ drew his colt and examined it briefly 6
 if he wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested he had his answer a moment later
 over this way! he ain't gone far! a harsh cry floated to him across the brush
 a carbine cracked more loudly and a slug clipped fragments from the brush off at one side
 the would-be assassin had his position figured pretty close 9
 dismounting russ looked about hastily
 toward the west this depression led toward a draw 8
 leading his pony he hurried that way not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding range
 swinging up then and bending forward over the horn he urged his mount down the meandering draw
 he had not covered a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind
 he had been sighted and his attacker pumping shot after shot 10
 a shot or two went wild before cobb felt something tug at his foot
 a slug had torn half of his stirrup-guard away 10
 a second twitched his shirtsleeve and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm
 jumping jerusalem! let's get out of here! at the first shot russ had hurled his mount to the left toward the side of the winding draw 7
 the long minute before he reached effective cover seemed endless 9
 sweeping a look around he saw that he was safe for the moment 7
 he heard cries from behind him but he could make out no words 7
 he dashed madly for the next elbow turn in the draw and made it 9
 recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an intersecting draw he plunged forward with undiminished speed
 gradually the wash climbed upward forcing him toward open range 8
 yet he must chance it
 he clambered out of the dwindling wash the loose dirt flying behind him and flashed a look about
 early in november the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions
 and sweeney squadron put its first marks on the combat record 10
 every plane that could fly was sent into the air
 cricket took eight ships and went south across the straits and along the north coast of mindanao to cagayan
 anything the enemy flew or floated was his target 6
 fleischman with eight was to patrol the leyte gulf area with his main task to get any kamikaze before they got to the ships 6
 greg himself took two flights with todman leading the second to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around ormoc on the east coast of leyte
 each plane carried two five-hundred pound bombs 11
 a weapons carrier took greg todman belton banjo ferguson and walters and the others the two miles from the bivouac area to the strip
 it was a rough long ride through the mud and pot holes 14
 no one had much to say
 the sky glowered down at them
 there was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever
 the truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread through the jungle
 donovan snatched greg's chute from him with a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it
 his face was dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his pilot
 greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been in one before
 but his hands and those of donovan moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure
 i've got her as neat as i can donovan said as he dropped the straps of the seton harness over greg's shoulders
 it's for carabao not airplanes
 don't you worry chief greg replied wondering if he himself believed it
 see you donovan said as he jumped off the wing 9
 the expression was his trade-mark his open sesame to good luck and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return
 at the prearranged time greg started the engine and taxied out 12
 from the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight he knew donovan would keep his back to the strip 6
 he wondered where the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief to watch his plane take off on a combat mission
 yet long before the scheduled time for return donovan would be watching for every speck in the sky
 greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip and one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him
 the dark brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful
 the pilots' heads looked ridiculously small 10
 the control tower gave him immediate take-off permission and the clean roar of the engine that took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of donovan
 greg's mission was the last to leave and as he circled the ships off tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again 7
 to the west the dark green hills of leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway up their slopes
 underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray 8
 water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and out of showers
 the metal strip they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it
 he possessed the fighter pilot's horror of bad weather and instrument flying and he wondered if the ceiling did drop whether he and the other flights would be able to find their way back in this unfamiliar territory
 he shivered in the warm cockpit
 the overcast was solid above him
 as far as he could see there was no hole to climb through it 13
 they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separated leyte from samar and hope that it didn't close in before they returned
 greg pushed the radio button on his throttle
 todman let's try to go under this stuff
 stay in close and we'll go up the valley
 roger sweeney todman called back and pulled his four in and slightly above greg
 greg took the formation wide around three a-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the gulf
 he dropped down to five hundred feet swinging a little north of the city of tacloban and punched into the opening that showed against the mountain
 the valley was only a few hundred yards wide with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree turn 9
 it was only a fifteen-minute flight but before it was through greg felt himself developing a case of claustrophobia
 the ceiling stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet and at times the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in 7
 if the other pilots were worried they did not show it 9
 when the sea was visible ahead of them the relief was as great as if the sun had come out
 he spread the flight out and led them across a point of land and then down the coast
 although they drew light ground fire they saw no signs of activity
 once todman thought he had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while greg covered him
 somebody beat us to it! todman said over the radio as he came back up in formation
 visibility continued to be limited and greg was never able to get above a thousand feet
 his earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts made by other flights
 he thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice of fleischman claiming a kill
 but greg's area remained as placid as a florida dawn 11
 finally as time began to run out he headed into ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses that intelligence had thought might contain japanese supplies
 the low clouds made bombing difficult
 there was not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run 11
 one of greg's bombs hung up and he was miles from the target before he could get rid of it
 only one of the flight scored a direct hit and the rest blew up jungle
 with their load of bombs gone the planes moved swiftly and easily
 greg went up tight against the ceiling and led them back to their pass to home
 mercifully it was still open
 like a man making a deep dive greg took full breath and plunged back into the valley
 he was about to make a gas check on his flight when todman's voice broke in: sweeneys! three bogies
 greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument panel 7
 he saw them specks against the gray but closing fast 10
 they were headed straight for each other on a collision course 8
 friend or enemy? 15
  the same old question
 and only a few seconds to answer it
 zeros! todman said excitedly and hopefully
 and then he thought todman might be right
 his mind flicked through the mental pictures he had from the hours of aircraft identification
 he narrowed the shape down to two: either a zero or a u s navy type aircraft
 if it were the enemy tactically his position was correct 13
 japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability american on speed and firepower
 his present maximum altitude up against the overcast gave him the opportunity to exploit his advantages
 but it also made him conspicuous to the enemy if it was the enemy and he hadn't been spotted already
 but the closing aircraft showed no sign of deviating from their original course
 in seconds greg made his decision
 he pushed the radio button
 sweeney blue hit the deck
 todman you take the one on the left
 belton the one on the right
 if h if they're japs
 greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two rogers
 the planes light with most of the gas burned out responded beautifully
 greg's airspeed indicator was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees
 the opposing aircraft continued to come on
 they appeared to be the enemy
 greg wished the air corps had continued to camouflage planes 6
 there was of course no way for the other planes to get by them
 but they could turn and escape to the east
 greg pushed the radio button again
 todman drop your second element back
 if any of us miss they can pick up the pieces 14
 now let's make sure they're japs
 even as he said it greg knew they had found the enemy 10
 the shapes were unmistakable and the rising suns were showing up slightly brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom
 greg slapped his hand across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight
 the circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector glass in front of him
 arm your guns sweeneys
 they're japs came a high-pitched voice
 one pass only
 you'll bust your ass in this canyon
 he moved the flights over against one wall
 it gave them all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery
 if the turn was too tight a barrel roll would bring them out 10
 a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be done 7
 greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the rpm and the engine responded as if it had been waiting 8
 the clearly identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around
 they haven't seen us greg yelled to himself over the engine noise 7
 he hit the radio button
 let's take 'em home
 he hauled back on the stick and felt his cheeks sag 7
 out of the corner of his eye he watched his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him
 with the rapid rate of closure the approach from below the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could be done 7
 just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer from a diving board
 his nose up
 it was going to be dangerous
 eight aircraft in this small box
 please dear god make my pilots good he prayed
 he took a lead on the enemy using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight and then added another
 the enemy did not veer
 it did not seem possible that they hadn't been spotted 11
 now! greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger
 the plane rumbled and slowed
 six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished 10
 as if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them
 greg tightened his turn until the plane shuddered 9
 his burst held for a second on the engine section of the plane 8
 the jap's propeller flew off in pieces
 a large piece of engine cowling vanished
 it was all greg had time to see
 his maneuvering for the shot had placed him near the overcast almost inverted and heading up into the clouds
 his speed was dropping rapidly
 if he spun out now he would join his opponent on the ground 8
 wingman stay clear he prayed
 he pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back 6
 he fought the panic of vertigo
 he had no idea which was up and which was down 10
 he held the controls where they had been
 sweat popped out over him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip
 his air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out 8
 over the rattling of fenders humming of tires and chattering of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles 6
 cool air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted of blooming roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirled from the back seat
 moriarty my driver suddenly exclaimed with something so definite so final in his tone i once more repeated the absurdity mustering all my latent powers of hypocrisy to sound convinced 4
 we were coming to an intersection turning right chuffing to a stop
 forced to realize that this was the end of a very short line i scanned a road marker and discovered what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old mexican: moriarty new mexico 6
 adios i said exhausting my spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters
 i waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass
 then i saw the father's head slightly turn; gauche rainbow shape s replaced the poignant ovals of gold
 white-shirted and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze
 suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled and thumbing hopefully i saw emergent in windshield flash: red lips streaming silk of blonde hair and- ah trembling confusion of hope apprehension despair- the leering face of old herry
 mor- ee-air-teeeee he shrieked his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde
 over the rapidly-diminishing outline of a jump seat piled high with luggage herry's black brushcut was just discernible near or enviably near that spot where- hidden- more delicately-textured most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming back in cool oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca flowers and engine fumes
 i would have foregone my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty and- well at least i wouldn't have shouted back a taunt
 still nursing anger i listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly approaching its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me
 just as i straightened up with my duffel bag i heard: sahjunt yoorick meet mrs major j a roebuck
 the voice was that of johnson tail gunner off another crew 8
 squeezing a look between johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome and still darkhaired lady inquired y'all drahve? 5
    i nodded
 onleh one thiihng mrs roebuck continued
 ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in sante fe an y'all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt
 but corporal johnson has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im
 i said that it didn't make any difference to me either as far as i knew
 how far i knew will shortly become apparent
 let me pass over the trip to sante fe with something of the same speed which made mrs roebuck wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit is still in ee-faket
 i let up on the accelerator only to gradually reach again the 60 mph which would i hoped overhaul herry and the blonde and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had i mrs major roebuck settled down to practicing on corporal johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on colonel and mrs somebody in sante fe
 when johnson ejaculated howsabout my buying us all a nice cold co-cola ma'am? 9
  mrs roebuck smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son who was onleh a little younguh than you bawhs 6
 johnson never would have believed she had a son that age 8
 mrs roebuck thought johns on was a sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet but her herman was getting to be a man there was no getting around it 5
 just befoh he left foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh major roebuck an ah an huhmun says 'may ah hev one too'? 6
  just as p'lite an- an cohnfidunt an ah says 'uh coahse you cain't' but he says 'whah nawt you ah hevin one'? 5
  an ah coudn ansuh him an so ah said 'aw right ah gay-ess an his fathuh didn uttuh one wohd an aftuh huhmun was gone the majuh laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t'gethuh f'ovuh a yeah onleh an occasional one but just the same it was behahn mah back an ah doan think thet's nahce at all d'you? 5
  no i don't johnson said
 i'm a good baptist and drinking h mrs roebuck very kindly let me drive through sante fe to a road which would she said lead us to taos and then raton and eventshahleh out of new mexico 4
 how lightly her eventshah-leh passed into the crannies where i was storing dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus and how the word would echo
 hardly had mrs roebuck driven off when a rusty pick-up truck father or grandfather of senor moriarty's ford sedan came screeching to a dust-swirling stop and a brown face appeared its nose threatened by shards of what had once been the side window
 the straight black hair flopped in a vigorous nod the slender nose plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back
 johnson unwired the right hand door whose window was like the left one merely loosely-taped fragments of glass and johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer 5
 in back buddy the driver said to me
 quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack i stepped on the running board; it flopped down sprang back up and gouged my shin
 the truck was hurtling forward
 i seized the rack and made a western-style flying-mount just in time one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel bag- and merely wrecking my camera i was to discover later- my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and- but this is no medical report 6
 i was again in motion and at a speed which belied the truck's similarity to senor x's ford turtle
 maybe i would beat old herry to siberia after all 8
 whatever satisfaction that might offer
 i drew back drawing back my foot for a kick
 but it was only johnson reaching around the wire chicken fencing which half covered the truck cab's glassless rear window 8
 the way his red rubber lips were stretched across his pearly little teeth i though he was only having a little joke but no he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into my ear
 wanna beer? 12
  hell yes i roared back between dusty lips
 did i want a beer? 11
  did an anteater want ants? 12
    bueno amigo
 gracias i hollered my first long swallow filling me with confidence and immediately doubling the size of my spanish vocabulary 7
 at once my ears were drowned by a flow of what i took to be spanish but- the driver's white teeth flashing at me the road wildly veering beyond his glistening hair beyond his gesticulating bottle- it could have been the purest oxford english i was half hearing; i wouldn't have known the difference
 johnson was trying to grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from it
 white teeth suddenly vanishing the driver slammed the side of his bottle against johnson's ear
 we were off the road gleaming barbed wire pulling taut 13
 i ducked just as the first strand broke somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards
 we were in a field in a tight screeching turn
 prairie dogs were popping up and popping down
 when i fell on my back i saw a vulture hovering 11
 just as i got to my knees there was again the sound of the fence stretching and i had time only to start taking my kneeling posture seriously
 this time no wire came whipping into the truck 12
 we were back on the road
 i regained my squatting position behind the truck cab's rear window
 johnson's left hand was pressed against the side of his head red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers
 tee-wah the driver cackled his black eyes glittering behind dull silver chicken fencing
 that was tee-wah i was talking
 you thought i was a mexican didn't you buddy? 13
  i nodded
 hell that's all right buddy the indian said
 miraculously the bottle was still in my hand foam still geysering over my waterproof watch
 no sooner had i started drinking than the driver started zigzagging the truc k
 i drank furiously
 emptied the bottle
 teeth again flashing back at me the driver released a deluge of spanish in which amigo appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of surrounding sound
 i bobbed my head each time it appeared
 suddenly the spanish became an english in which only one word emerged with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into johnson's quivering ribs 4
 a big car was approaching its chrome teeth grinning 11
 beyond it the gray road stretched a long long way 6
 the car was just about to us its driver's fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business on a family in sante fe- on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human beings desperately needed rescue
 high so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car's steel roof
 on unoccupied roadway the bottle shattered into a small amber flash
 aye-yah- ah-ah! the indian was again raising his bottle but to my astonished relief- probably only a fraction of johnson's- the bottle this time went to the indian's lips
 another car was coming a tiny dark shape on a far hill 8
 i started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board a dirt clod- anything i could throw and with better aim than i had thrown the beer bottle
 in the ditch sand was white and soft-looking only an occasional pebble discernible faintly gleaming
 but johnson couldn't quickly unwire the truck door and if i escaped he might suffer
 the car was approaching fast
 on the truck bed there was nothing smaller than a piece of rusty machinery; with more time i could have loosened a small burr or cotter pin-   suddenly and not a second too soon i thought of the coins in my pocket
 there was no time to pick out a penny; i got a coin between my thumb and forefinger leaned my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flipped my little missile 8
 there was a blur just under my focus of vision a crash; the car's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center
 i heard the screech of brakes behind me an insane burst of laughter beneath me
 looking back i saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car and trying to read our license number
 johnson's fat hand another bottle were protruding from the truck cab and that self-proclaimed baptist teetotaler had a bottle at his own lips
 two cars came over a crest their chrome and glass flashing 6
 the indian's arm whipped sidewise- there was a flash of amber and froth the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of the first car
 i saw johnson's bottle snatched from his hand saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car
 this time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking of women
 i looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated oval of the car's rear window
 drink you son of a bitch! i quickly turned around and began to drink
 but the indian was jabbing another bottle toward johnson 10
 i guided her to the divan turned off the tv faced her 10
 she sat quietly staring at me from the wide eyes
 and what eyes they were
 big and dark a melting golden brown
 eyes like hot honey eyes that sizzled
 plus flawless skin smooth brow and cheeks lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them
 it was a disturbingly familiar face too but i couldn't remember where we had met
 i said do we know each other miss? 9
    no i remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here and when it happened all i could think of was- this time she stopped the rush of words herself
 shall i go on? 9
  she smiled
 it was her first smile
 but one word at a time ok? 19
  she was still hugging the stained coat around her so i said relax let me take your things
 would you like a drink or coffee? 18
  no thanks
 she stood up pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off then let out a high-pitched scream and i let out a low-pitched wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out
 she was wearing nothing beneath the coat
 she jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again but not soon enough
 there had been a good second or two during which my muffle r had been blowing out and now i was certain i'd seen her somewhere before
 oh do forgive me
 i'm sorry! i forgive-   that's what started all the trouble in the first place
 oh dear i'm all unstrung
 you and me both dear
 haven't we h haven't i seen you h
 i mean surely we've-   you may have seen me on tv she said 9
 i've done several filmed commercials for- then it hit me 5
 and you recognized me? 10
    yes indeed
 in fact i was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell
 man you rang- it was in color too miss and h miss? 10
  what's your name anyway? 10
  ah you were splendid
 i sat by her on the divan
 in a waterfall h and all that
 that's the last one we did
 that was a fun one
 it was fun for me all right
 i don't mean to pry but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles? 5
  i mean: is advertising honest? 14
    it depends on who does it
 i never wear anything at all
 it wouldn't- wouldn't seem fair somehow
 i couldn't agree with you more
 i really do have something important to tell you mr scott 12
 murder? 15
  oh yeah i said
 tell me about the murde r
 zing was the creation of two men louis thor and bill blake partners in zing! inc
 they'd peddled the soap virtually alone and without much success until about a year ago when- with the addition of sx-21 to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign- sales had soared practically into orbit
 their product had been endorsed by good housekeeping the ama and the veterinary journal among other repositories of higher wisdom and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in the john even your best friends would think you didn't bathe 5
 my lovely caller- joyce holland was her name- had previously done three filmed commercials for zing and this evening the fourth a super production had been filmed at the home of louis thor
 the water in thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick foamy soapsuds- fashioned of course from zing- joyce had dived from the board into the pool then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious bath while cameras rolled
 the finished- and drastically cut- product would begin with a hazy longshot of joyce entering the suds then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender lather and i had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap; even to clean men and boys 4
 joyce went on when we'd finished lou- mr thor- asked me to stay a little longer
 he wanted a few stills for magazine ads he said 10
 everybody left and i stayed in the pool then lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too
 and he didn't have any clothes on
 he didn't!   yes he didn't
 did leap into the pool and didn't have anything on 7
 anyway it was evident what he had in mind
 you got away didn't you? 13
    yes
 he caught up with me once and grabbed me but i was all covered with zing- it's very slippery you know
 i wouldn't have the stuff in the house
 but i'm pleased to hear-   so i just scooted out of his clutches
 i swam like mad got out of the pool grabbed my robe and ran to the car
 the keys were still in it and i was miles away before i remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where i'd changed
 she'd driven around for a while joyce said then thinking louis thor would have calmed down by that time she'd gone back to his home on bryn mawr drive parked in front and walked toward the pool 5
 while several yards from it still concealed by the shrubbery she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge 5
 she went on:   a man was holding onto lou holding him up 9
 maybe lou was only unconscious but right then i thought he must be dead
 the man shoved him into the water then ran past the cabana 11
 there's a walk there that goes out to quebec drive 3
 i was so scared h well i just ran to my car and came here 9
 you know who the other man was? 12
    no i never did see his face
 i didn't get a good look at him at all his back was to me and i was so scared h it was just somebody in a man's suit
 but i'm sure the other one was lou
 what joyce wanted me to do was go to thor's house and do whatever detectives do and get her clothes- and handbag containing her identification
 she realized i'd have to notify the police but fervently hoped i could avoid mentioning her name
 her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming tv series underwater western eye a documentary-type show to be sponsored by oatnut grits 5
 but if joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal the role would probably go to the sponsor's wife mrs oatnut grits 8
 or at least not to joyce
 and i so want the part she said
 the commercials have just been for money there hasn't been any real incentive for me to do them but in underwater western eye i'd have a chance to act
 i could show what i can do
 as far as i was concerned she had already and had dandily shown what she could d o
 but i promised joyce i would mention her name if at all only as a last resort
 seeming much relieved she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles and i smiled all the way into the bedroom
 there i got my colt special and shoulder harness slipped my coat on and went back into the front room
 joyce squirmed a little on the divan
 i'm starting to itch she said
 itch? 15
    yes i'm still all covered with that soap 11
 i was loaded with suds when i ran away and i haven't had a chance to wash it off
 you might as well wait here while i'm gone so you can use my shower if you'd like
 i showed her the shower and tub and she said smiling if you really don't mind i think i'll get clean in the shower then soak for a few minutes in your tub
 doesn't it you? 13
    only when i do it
 one of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color 9
 soak h as long as you want joyce
 it'll probably be at least an hour or two before i can check back with you
 so you'll have everything all to yourself doggone h i looked at my watch
 time to go i supposed
 you'd better hurry
 oh you can count on that
 warmly
 i'll be soaking for h at least half an hour
 that was all she said
 but suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them
 however when there's a job to be done i'm a monstrosity of grim determination i like to think
 i spun about and clattered through the front room to the door 11
 as i went out i could hear water pouring in the shower 9
 she wouldn't be taking a cold shower
 bryn mawr drive is only two or three miles from the spartan and it took me less than five minutes to get there
 but the scene was not the quiet calm scene i'd expected 13
 four cars were parked at the curb and two of them were police radio cars
 lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds 9
 i followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool
 two uniformed officers a couple of plain-clothesmen i knew and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left 7
 at the pool's far end was the little cabana joyce had mentioned and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather
 a few yards beyond the group of men a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra
 lieutenant rawlins one of the plain-clothesmen spotted me and said hi shell and walked toward me
 how'd you hear about this one? 10
  i grinned but ignored the question
 he didn't push it; rawlins worked out of central homicide and we'd been friends for years
 a call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine pm and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that- 10 minutes ago now
 present at the scene- in addition to the dead man who was indeed louis thor- had been thor's partner bill blake and antony rose an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account 7
 neither of them i understood had been present at the filming session earlier
 what were they doing here? 14
  i asked rawlins
 they were supposed to meet thor at nine pm for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap a new angle based on this sx-21 stuff
 yeah i've heard more about sx-21 than space exploration lately 6
 what is the gunk? 28
    how would i know? 12
  it's a secret
 that was the new advertising angle- something about a lloyd's of london policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient 7
 actually only two men know what the formula is blake and- he stopped and looked at thor's body
 i said ok so now only blake knows
 how's it strike you foul or fair? 9
  can't say yet
 deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em
 the pm might show he drowned instead but that's what the once-over-lightly gives us
 accident murder suicide- take your pick
 anything else? 12
    according to rose he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted thor in the water got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out
 too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education is to help you make a living; this is not so for education offers all kinds of dividends including how to pull the wool over a husband's eyes while you are having an affair with his wife 6
 if it were not for an old professor who made me read the classics i would have been stymied on what to do and now i understand why they are classics; those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick
 i worked for my uncle who ran one of those antique shops in new orleans' vieux carre the old french quarter
 the arrangement i had with him was to work four hours a day 9
 the rest of the time i devoted to painting or to those other activities a young and healthy man just out of college finds interesting
 i had a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with flowers and plants blooming everlastingly in the southern sun 7
 i had come to new orleans two years earlier after graduating college partly because i loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted art colony there
 when my uncle offered me a part-time job which would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint i accepted 7
 the arrangement turned out to be excellent
 i loved the city and i particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of mardi gras
 i had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide joyous celebration with romance in the air; and when you took a walk you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting around the next corner
 the very faces of the people bore this expectation of fun and pleasure
 it was as if they could hardly wait to get into their costumes cover their faces with masks and go adventuring
 my uncle and i were not too close socially because of the difference in our ages
 sometimes i wondered vaguely what he did about women for my aunt by blood had died some years ago but neither of us said anything 6
 one monday morning i saw him approach the store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new aunt
 they were married over the week-end though he was easily sixty and she could not have been even thirty
 she looked more like twenty-five or six
 it was really a may and december combination 13
 my new aunt was perhaps three or four years older than i and it had been a long time since i had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex
 there was something about the contour of her face her smile that was like new orleans sunshine the way she held her head the way she walked- there was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me
 her legs were the full sexy kind full bodied like a rare wine and just as tantalizing to the appetite; the calf was magnificent the ankle perfect
 you must forgive me if i seem to dwell too much on her physical aspects but i am an artist accustomed to studying the physical body 7
 the true artist is like one of those scientists who from a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body
 the artist looks at an ankle a calf a bosom and in his mind's eye the clothes drop away and he sees her as she really is 5
 and that is the way i first saw her when my uncle brought her into his antique store
 that she impressed me instantly was obvious; i was aware that when our eyes met we both quickly averted them
 i thought i saw a faint surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks
 true she was my aunt married to an uncle related to me only by marriage but why she had married a man twice her age and more perhaps i did not know or much care
 she was standing with her back to the glass door 11
 her form was silhouetted and with the strong light i could see the outlines of her body a body that an artist or anyone else would have admired
 as it is in so many affairs of the heart a man and a woman meet and something clicks
 something clicked in this instance but i treated her circumspectly and i felt that she knew it for we both kept our distance 5
 when she appeared at the store to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious lest my uncle notice it 9
 and then i became aware that she too glanced at me surreptitiously
 i felt that her eyes were undressing me as if she were a painter and i a nude model
 i dismissed these feelings as wishful thinking but i could not get it out of my head that we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared to dwell on it because of our relationship 5
 when our eyes met the air was filled with an unuttered message of me too
 you have probably experienced this
 it is nothing you can put your fingers on but the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity
 why she married him i do not know
 i myself was fond of him but what a young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me
 he already had that slow pace that comes over the elderly while she herself had all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living
 perhaps with my uncle she found a measure of economic security that she needed; or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father; some women with father fixations do
 for several weeks we eyed one another almost like sparring partners and then one day uncle was slightly indisposed and stayed home; his bride opened the store
 i was waiting in front of it when she showed up and told me of my uncle's indisposition
 even as she was telling me about it i became aware of a give-away flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks and subconsciously i realized that when she entered the store she did not switch on the lights
 the cavernous depth cluttered with antiques echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the rear and took the seat at his desk
 she placed her palms fingers outspread on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say now what next? 6
  i was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me the time was opportune
 there was little likelihood of any customers walking in at that hour
 i was standing beside her watching the outspread palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes napped
 i bent and kissed the still pink neck and suddenly she jumped up and her two arms encircled me in a bear-like crush
 her mouth which had been so much in my thoughts was warm and moist and tender
 i heard her murmur we'd better lock the door
 it did not take me long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and its couch
 when we opened the door again for business and switched on the lights she said: he will not always be indisposed
 i was thinking about that
 how will we work it out? 9
    i don't know she said
 you figure it out
 i've noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met 8
 i guess we both felt it
 i guess so she said
 but now what? 22
    even as i said it i realized that an education can be invaluable
 i know what we can do i said
 tell him i made a pass at you
 she raised a protesting hand with a startled air 6
 what are you trying to do? 14
  get thrown out? 12
  if i even hint at it do you think it will matter that you are his nephew- and not even a blood nephew? 8
  i don't want to be thrown out and i don't think i will 6
 i think i have a way so we can carry on without his suspecti ng us
 by telling him you are making passes at me? 7
  she said incredulously
 when i was in college i grinned i remember a poem i had to read in my lit class
 i don't even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century poets
 in those days poems often told a story in verse and those boys had some corkers to tell; and now i think we can use the knowledge they passed on to us
 tomorrow mardi gras opens officially
 a lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks and having a ball
 there will be romance and flirtation
 if you tell him i made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something i said or did so instead of just telling him i made a pass say i tried to date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse i really am
 we made a rendezvous tomorrow evening at nine on some street near lake ponchartrain
 and to prove what you tell him about me you suggest that he keep the date instead
 you are both the same size
 he could use your clothes for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask
 when i show up he will know you are a good wife to have told him about it
 don't worry about me
 it will turn out all right
 i don't understand she insisted
 are you trying to cut your throat? 16
  no i chuckled i'm just beginning to collect dividends on my investment in education
 as we expected on the following day my uncle was completely recovered and opened the store as usual at 10 in the morning 8
 i felt that he looked at me coldly and appraisingly and seemed to be uncertain what his attitude towards me should be but he did not say one word which might indicate that he had been told of advances to his wife
 i quit work at my usual hour as if this day was no different from other days
 i heard subsequently that my uncle and aunt had dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he went home to get into his costume to keep the date
 shortly before nine i drove my jalopy to the street facing the lake and parked the car in shadows far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view
 a few minutes later i saw my uncle's car drive up and a woman's figure emerge and walk to the corner
 i must say the figure was well made up
 if it were not that i knew who it was i could have mistaken it for my aunt so well did her clothes fit him
 in one hand he gripped firmly a parasol though there had been no indication of rain
 i suspected why he brought it along
 in the half darkness i approached cautiously making sure he did not see me
 he was looking out on the dark waters of the lake when i came upon him and without wasting words i smacked him hard across the face 6
 you cheap bitch! i exclaimed
 you cheap no good two-timing bitch! you get a good loyal husband- smack!- and you fall for a pass by his own nephew! you should- smack!- be ashamed of yourself
 he had better write a postcard to walter
 he opened the myth book again and there were the names of four munich bars and meredith wilder's address
 the bars were marked as walter had marked them in a small black book kept in a nearly secret drawer
 the code which had probably something to do with sex or some other interest nicolas was determined to find out and put to use 6
 a card to walter would get him an introduction to this meredith and that might be good for something
 nicolas called on his muse a line came back:   squaresville man and all the palazzos are crummy palasts
 that ought to draw a laugh nicolas reasoned as he stored the line away on the wax tape that was his mind
 and indeed his postcard did draw from walter a letter recommending his friend the poet nicolas manas to his friend meredith wilder 5
 five days later on receiving it meredith sat drumming his dactyls on his writing table
 his hand was large and square and heavily tanned
 the voice crying in him was the voice of guilt 12
 his four weeks in italy had turned into nearer three months 6
 he had returned to the pension a week ago 14
 now he was just in the late poems of ho^lderlin and therefore had most of the nineteenth century before him- plus next semester's class preparation
 he was determined to spend an industrious summer 15
 well maybe manas wouldn't call
 meredith's fingers slowed and stopped over a line before him: sie la^cheln die schwarzen hexen
 the menace of manas gradually faded as meredith asked himself should he translate it 'how the dark fates laughed'? 5
  or more rhythmically 'the swarthy witches are laughing'? 10
  and he missed the point that the swarthy witches might be laughing at him for hoping to escape nicolas manas
 but nicolas too was being interrupted that morning 9
 not by the 11:00 sun which had spread a warmth around his spot of grass in the english gardens and sent him off to sleep; but by a blond girl in a sweater and skirt who stood a few yards off and tenderly regarded him
 should she wake him? 15
  she didn't have the heart
 her heart her maternal feeling in fact her h her being was too busy expressing itself as quietly thrilled by this sight of her nicolas curled asleep under a blanket in a park like a scene from poussin 5
 she was just not able to break the spell
 known that the blanket belonged to a young ballet dancer nicolas had found his first night in one of walter's marked bars? 7
  nicolas: look nicolas doesn't go to bed with boys- no sex see? 6
  so if all these beers was to get me in bed man you just spent a lot of money
 ballet dancer: protests tears and take what you want nicolas i am a dancer you are a poet it is all beautiful
 to this meek conjugation nicolas had replied ok i can use this blanket
 and when you get off this job tonight well you can gimme something to eat
 and as a matter of fact nicolas had slept in the park only part of one night when he discovered that munich's early mornings even in summer are laden with dew
 he had always known how to find a bed and on his own terms 9
 he used the blanket for late morning naps when hosts of the night had gone off to jobs and proved reluctant to leave him in their small rooms with their few her nicolas lay curled in the sun like a fawn black hair falling over his eyes
 she was telling herself that this might just be her reward at the end of a long meaningful search for truth
 this was surely a reunion in art it was all that poetry promised 10
 that long night with nicolas and marijuana in venice had opened her eyes
 his advice his voice saying his poems the fact that he had not so much as touched her- on the contrary he had put his head back and she had stroked his hair- this was all new
 her eyes had opened she had caught a glimpse of a new faith 6
 the next day he was gone
 mary jane might not be the most intelligent woman but she was one of the most determined
 even so it took her several days to force walter to tell her nicolas's whereabouts
 packing a small suitcase informing her husband whom she found in harry's bar that she was taking a train to germany to get away for a while patting his arm refusing a drink getting on the train- all this had only taken her two hours
 she had arrived this morning and come straight to the english gardens
 dear girl walter had finally said he writes me that he is sleeping in the english gardens
 how like him! mary jane had smilingly said 11
 his address walter added is that great foundling home the american express
 and i will greatly appreciate it if you will not tell your husband h
 for the last half hour mary jane had criss-crossed half the length of the gardens and at last come upon her knight
 his presence there asleep in the grass confirmed all that mary jane believed it was in his power to teach her: freedom from the tedium of needs such as hotels the meaning of nature how to live simply with the angels
 she set down her suitcase
 should she wake him? 15
  no
 smiling she sat down on the suitcase and waited and watched 7
 the sun grew hotter as it approached the midday
 nicolas was dreaming he had his head pressed against the dashboard of a speeding car
 in his dream he cried slow down for chrissake! he half woke and rolled over with his face in the cooler grass
 he blew his nose expertly between his fingers
 he half sat up and scratched at the hair on his forehead and then more vigorously between his legs
 mary jane got up quietly and walked away
 twenty minutes later she was at the desk of the gra^fin's pension her tears dried signing a hotel form and asking for a bath 6
 mary jane belonged to a world acquainted with small attractive hotels and pensions in all the major and minor cities 7
 she had retreated to this world
 the gra^fin who was charmed by her told her your sister who was here two years ago has quite dark hair
 nevertheless there is no bath
 but a young american has a bath next to his room and i shall ask him if you might use it this once
 and then we shall see h
 meredith was irritated when the gra^fin knocked at his door and told him she is a great beauty! shall we allow her not to have a bath? 7
  actually she is a sad beauty i believe
 you shall see her at dinner
 rather erotically he listened to the bath water running; when it stopped he began busily typing sitting up in a virtuous way 6
 before dinner he shaved for the second time that day 9
 a thing he did not like doing generally
 singing into the mirror and his interested eyes he was pleased to note when he stripped for his own bath that he still had the best part of his italian sun tan
 he flexed his muscles for several minutes got into the tub and then grew self-conscious of splashing as he washed
 in the small gallery used as the guests' dining room meredith sat down at his place and as always began teasing the young waitress
 he was asking had it been she who left the love note in his sheets when he saw the gra^fin followed by a stately blond girl approaching his table
 it would be literary license calculated to glamorize life to say that he oh dropped his napkin so startled was he by mary jane's beauty
 yet he did drop his badinage with the ordinary country girl as much in deference to the gra^fin as acknowledgement that here indeed was something special
 mary jane had made very little effort
 above a dark green skirt she wore a pale green cashmere sweater with as he soon perceived no brassiere beneath
 her white blond hair was clean and brushed long straight down to her shoulders
 perhaps her eyes were larger and more of a summer blue for all they had seen and wept that day
 she had touched her face truly a noble and pure face only with a lip salve which made her lips glisten but no redder than usual 7
 the result was grace and modesty
 as she was rather tired this evening her simple thank you for the use of your bath- when she sat down opposite him- spoken in a low voice came across with coolnesses of intelligence and control 7
 meredith began falling in love
 soup: only this morning; veal cutlets: oh i couldn't possibly eat all this!; wine: then you were typing poems this afternoon? 6
 ; fruit compote: if you think i would understand it; a smile 7
 like h as if it were built of books
 having opened the windows onto the terrace lit the fire translated the motto meredith grinned and took down a little triplet of books bound together in old calfskin
 opening these he brought out a schnapps bottle and small gold thimble-sized glasses hidden inside it
 i think the maids tipple in the afternoon
 those sweet girls? 18
  oh h you're joking
 it tastes a little like poppyseed
 what's its name? 7
  steinha^ger h she whispered steinha^ger to herself several times memorizi ng it
 would you first read the poem aloud to me and then let me read it to myself? 7
  meredith's voice was always deep with rough bass notes in it; in reading on platforms even in the large auditorium of the ymha poetry center nights his voice was intimate thoughtful and a trifle shy
 his new poem a love poem told of a young husband leading his wife upstairs to the bedroom when the lights in the house have failed 6
 the husband points the steps out with his flashlight: its white stare filling her pale eyes to the blind brim with appetite bleaching her hands that grazed my thighs and sent us from the table in surprise to let the dishes soak all night but he read o n 6
 in the bedroom before the husband and wife find their way to the bed the lights go on: in dull domestic radiance i watch her staring face still blind start wincing in obedience to dirty waters counters pots and pans waiting below stairs in her mind
 mary jane took the page from him and began reading it moving her lips with the words
 oh it's that myth about orpheus and h what is her name? 6
  i can never pronounce it
 the third time rather urgently
 but with her hand poem again
 she raised her face and nodded it's sweet and very sad 7
 they discussed the way people never tell each other the things on their minds
 they finished the small bottle of steinha^ger
 she confessed she was unhappy he asked was it her husband? 9
  she began to explain there was this poet in italy h he interrupted please don't judge all poets
 at her door two or three hours later mary jane whispered everyone is asleep
 kissing her he whispered several times eurydice 7
 the third time rather urgently
 but with her hand softly on his cheek for a last moment she closed the door and he went back down the hall and into his bed excited expectant and finally faintly grinning with the feel of her hand against his mouth
 they were west of the sabine but only god knew where 11
 for three days their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea
 molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson; suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping; dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs
 and the valley stretched endlessly out ahead scorched and baked and writhing in its heat until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze
 ben prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxe n
 hoa-whup! he commanded from his raw throat and felt the pain of movement in his cracked black burned lips
 he removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face
 the dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton 7
 he moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs 9
 the burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches
 he cleared his throat and wet his lips
 as cheerfully as possible he said well i guess we could all do with a little drink
 he unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel 10
 they could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation
 the water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste 10
 thank the lord they still had water!   he cleansed his mouth with a small quantity
 he took a long but carefully controlled draught 13
 he replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck
 she took it grudgingly her dark eyes baleful as they met his 9
 she drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face
 she set the dipper on the edge of the deck leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully
 what happens when there's no more water? 9
  she asked smolderingly
 she was like charcoal he thought- dark opaque explosive 9
 her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal 9
 her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up 7
 and all the time she had the heat of hatred in her like charcoal that is burning on its under side but not visibly
 a ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws but he kept control upon his voice
 there must be some water under there
 he tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river 7
 we can get it if we dig he said patiently
 and add fever to our troubles? 10
  she scoffed
 or do you want to see if i can stand fever too? 8
    we can boil it he said
 we're lost and burning up already she bit out tensely 5
 the tires are rattling on the wheels now 11
 they'll roll off in another day
 there was no valley like this on your map
 you don't even know where we're headed
 hettie he said as gently as he could we're still headed west 8
 somewhere we'll hit a trail
 maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves 12
 in a way he couldn't blame her
 he had picked out this pathless trail instead of the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give them privacy on their honeymoon 8
 it had been a mistake but anything would have been a mistake as it turned out
 it wasn't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her
 she had hated the whole idea before they started 9
 actually she had hated him before she ever saw him 9
 it had been five days too late before he learned that she'd gone through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum administered by her mother
 the bitterness of their wedding night still ripped within him like an open wound
 she had jumped away from his shy touch like a cat confronted by a sidewinder
 he had left her inviolate thinking familiarity would gentle her in time
 but each mile westward she had hated him the deeper 8
 he stared at the dipper turning it over and over in his wide calloused hands
 i suppose he muttered i can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to your folks once we find a settlement
 don't try to be noble! her laugh was hard
 they wouldn't have sold me in the first place if there'd been food enough to go around
 hettie they didn't sell you he said miserably 9
 they knew i was a good sharecrop farmer back in carolina but out west was a chance to build a real farm of our own
 they thought it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what's inside of them
 without money or property what would you have had at baton rouge? 6
    i might have starved but at least i wouldn't be fried to a crisp and soaked with dirt! he darkened under his heavy burn 7
 his blue eyes sought the shimmering sea of haze ahead 7
 to his puzzlement there suddenly was no haze 13
 the valley lay clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt scoured hills that formed the horizon twenty miles ahead
 then he noticed the clouds racing upon them- heavy ominous leaden clouds that formed even as they sliced over the crests of the surrounding hills
 he had never seen clouds like them before but he had the primitive feel of danger that gripped a man before a hurricane in carolina
 he hollered hoarsely hang on! and goaded the oxen as he yelled 9
 he wanted to turn them putting the wagon against the storm 11
 too late he realized that in turning he had wheeled them onto a patch of sandy ground instead of atop a grade or ridge
 he swung up over the wheel
 you had better get inside he warned her
 but she sat on in stubborn silence
 the clouds bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel
 frozen they stared at it whirling down the valley gouging and spitting out boulders and chunks of earth like a starving hound dog cracking marrowbones
 the six-ton conestoga began to whip and shake 11
 it was filled with dust and wind and sound and violence 13
 the heavens opened pelting them with hail the size of walnuts 12
 and then came the water- not rain but solid sheets that sluiced down like water slopping from a bucket
 walls of water rushed down the slopes and filled the hollows like the crests of flash floods
 through the splash of the rising waters they could hear the roar of the river as it raged through its canyon gnashing big chunks out of the banks
 the jetting frothing surface of the river reached the level of the runoff
 the dangerous current upon the prairie ceased but the water stood and kept on rising
 they cringed under sodden covers listening to the waves slop against the bottom
 the cloudburst cut off abruptly
 they were engulfed by the weird silence broken only by the low angry murmur of the river
 then the darkness thinned and there was light again and then bright sunlight
 beaten with fear and sound and wet and chill they crawled to the hurricane deck and looked out haggardly at a world of water that reached clear to the surrounding hills
 the water level was higher than their hubs
 only the heavy bones of the oxen kept them anchored 10
 there was no real sign of the river now just a roiling oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy waters that reached everywhere 8
 clumps of brush rode down the ribbon
 now and then the glistening side of a half-swamped object showed as it swept past
 the girl crawled out into the renewing warmth of the sunshine hugging her shoulders and still trembling
 her face was pale but set and her dark eyes smoldered with blame for ben
 out of compulsion to say something cheery ben prime blurted well we were lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit
 at least the wheels dug in
 the soaking will put life back in the wagon too 11
 his wife didn't give a sign she'd heard
 she was watching a tree ride wildly down that roiling current 10
 somebody was riding the tree
 it raced closer and they could see a woman with white hair sitting astride an upright branch
 she did not call out
 but as the tree passed she lifted an arm in gesture of better luck and farewell
 they watched the tree until it twisted sharply on a bend 7
 it speared up into the air then sinking back the up-jutting branch turned slowly
 the pale blob of the woman disappeared
 there's the one who's lucky! the girl murmured harshly 8
 ben's eyes strained with the bitter hurt his homely face slashed with gray and crimson
 then he took off his wet boots and dropped down into the water to talk with the beasts needing their comfort more than they needed his 7
 it was nearly sundown and he went to the back of the wagon half-swimming his way for he was not a tall man
 he let down the tailgate and was knocked over by the sluice of water
 he sputtered back to his feet and scrambled madly to pull his bags of seed grain forward
 they were already swollen to bursting
 of all their worldly belongings next to the oxen and his gun the seed grain had been the most treasured
 it was spoiled now for seed and it would sour and mold in three days if they failed to find a place and fuel to dry it 9
 the oxen might as well enjoy it
 he examined the water marks on the iron tires when the animals were finished
 the waters lay muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheels; there was not a match-width of damp mark to show they were receding
 he doubted if a man could wade as far as the desolate dry hills that rimmed the valley
 a terrible numbing sense of futility swept over him 8
 he gripped the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat 11
 then he noticed that the dry wood of the wheels had swollen 8
 the spokes were tight again the iron tires gripped onto the wheels as if of one piece
 he swung toward the front to give the news to hettie then stopped barred from her by the vehemence of her blame and hate 5
 a tight wagon meant so much
 he got a small fire started and put on bacon and coffee 9
 he poured the water off the sourdough and off the flour salvaging the chunky watery messes for biscuits of a sort 7
 their jams and jellies had not suffered
 he found a jar of preserved tomatoes and one of eggs that they had meant to save
 now he broke them open hoping a good meal might lessen this depression crushing hettie
 his long nose wiggled at the smells of frizzling bacon and heating java but the fire was low and he wanted to waste no time 7
 he furled the slashed sides of the canvas tarpaulins leaving the ribs and wagon open
 he looked thoughtfully at his wife's trunk holding her meager treasures
 he said hesitantly hettie i don't figure your things got wet too much
 if you want to get them aired h   she said without turning her head after that rain beating in atop the dust there isn't a thing that won't be streaked
 he drew a long breath and opened the trunk and hung out her clothes and spoilables upon the wagon ribs
 sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of
 i suppose a lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze
 now roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep not knowing what to do h
 the lifeboats were stuck fast
 i heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man's bare back
 he sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters
 one especially bad detonation shook lifeboat no 3 which trembled violently in the davits
 brassnose yelled: come on sommers max h step on it we got a chance now
 heave on those ropes; the boat's come unstuck
 we pulled and swore and yanked and wept scraping our hands until they bled profusely
 the bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare
 her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water
 brassnose max and i leaped into the sea and swam to the boat 7
 let's get away fast said brassnose shaking water from his mop of bleached hair
 that tub is going to explode all at once
 then the bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam geysers of sparks and flames and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke
 dimly we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno
 already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water
 sommers you bale while we row brassnose commanded 9
 as best as i could determine we were some 700 miles west of new guinea in the bismark archipelago
 three days previously we had steamed past barren rennell island in the distance
 now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the pacific for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon
 there were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands; our muscles were hot wires of pain
 the big man with the whitened hair murmured something: his words sounded as if they were in the manu tongue which i recognized having studied the dialect in my anthropology 6 class at the university of chicago
 he then said something which struck a chord in my memory 11
 god help us if we're near the island of eromonga 7
 we'd be in real trouble then
 i'd rather keep bailing- or sink
 i was puzzled by the remark then i recalled the voice of mild professor howard griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies
 he had been speaking of this archipelago:   even when the islands were under german mandate before world war 1 europeans gave eromonga a wide berth
 the place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are anachronisms of the twentieth century- stone age amazons who live in an all-female matriarchal society which is self-sufficient 7
 i remembered too the jesting voice of a classmate bobby pauson: but how do they reproduce dr griggs? 6
  i'm sure that males have something to do with that process!   there had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as professor griggs said dryly: i see your point pauson
 of course males play a role there but believe me when i say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on eromonga
 indeed you wouldn't live long for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods
 in fact one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men
 i think i know what you mean brassnose i said
 i know something about eromonga
 let's hope we come to a safer place
 three hours later while we were bailing desperately a dot of land came into view
 foster lukuklu frayne made a sign over his heart with his two linked thumbs: i recognized it as an ancient manu gesture intended to propitiate the devil
 a half-hour passed; we had drifted closer
 in a voice so frightened as to seem not his own the big bo'sun's mate quavered:   tchalo! it is eromonga- look hard you can see with your naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff 7
 i squinted at the looming shoreline
 there was a wooden tower or derrick there something like a ski jump; it was perhaps 80 feet high and had been artfully constructed of logs
 a fine example of engineering in a primitive society 8
 what is the scaffolding for brassnose? 20
  he made a sound of despair deep in his throat 6
 it was embarrassing to see strapping blonde brassnose comport himself like a child who talks about bogeymen
 aaa-ee! it is their tultul the 'jumping platform' of death 6
 it is the last of the three tests of manhood which the women impose to discover if a male in worthy of survival there
 often i heard my uncles and cousins speak of it when i was a small boy growing up in rabaul
 they had never seen a tultul but they had heard about it from their fathers
 our lifeboat was filling rapidly and despite what i had heard of the inhabitants of eromonga i was glad to see a long and graceful outrigger manned by three bronzed girls glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward our craft
 i expected brassnose- as a man with a strain of melanesian in his blood- to speak to them
 but he had turned a sickly green and appeared tongue-tied or panicked
 so i mustered my few words of the manu dialect and said we greet you in peace
 my friends and i come from a ship which was destroyed by fire 6
 we are thirsty and hungry; our sore and burned hands and arms need attention
 the girl in the prow of the outrigger turned a smile like a beacon on me
 i noted that her full breasts were bare and that she wore a garland of red pandanus fruit in her blue-black hair 8
 she said my name is songau and these girls are ponkob and piwen
 you are welcome to eromonga
 my people await you on the shore
 you shall have food water and rest
 thirty minutes later the outrigger grated on sand and other girls waiting on shore rushed forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine ropes to a large boulder
 i saw a dozen or so other outriggers moored there 11
 all my rosy visions of rest and even pleasure on this island vanished at the sight
 there was a mound of bleached human bones and skulls at the base of the big wooden derrick
 some had been there for years; others still had whitened shreds of decayed flesh sticking to them
 there was one object which sickened yet fascinated me 17
 this was also a corpse- a male judging from the coral arm bands the tribal scars still discernible on the maggoty face the painted bone of the warrior caste which still pierced the septum of the rotting nose
 the body may have been two or three weeks' dead 13
 i looked with revulsion at the legs
 many small bones protruded crazily from the shreds of flesh 9
 the man must have leaped to his death from the topmost rung of the tultul
 as if divining my thoughts the girl songau smiled warmly and said in the casual tone an american woman might use in describing her rose garden: this is our tultul a jumping platform maku
 later you shall know it better
 is it not well-made? 31
  our old one blew down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moons ago
 it took thirty of our women almost six moons to build this one which is higher and stronger than the old one
 we are very proud of it
 you have every right to be i replied gravely in the manu dialect but my attention was fixed on brassnose the biggest and strongest of us
 he looked as if he was going to keel over
 i felt a queasiness in my own stomach but it wouldn't do to show these girls that we were afraid
 i clapped the big man with the bleached hair on his shoulder and said heartily hoping it would make an impression on the women: this one is the maku frayne
 he speaks your language too for he is the grandson of a chieftain on taui who made much magic and was strong and cunning 7
 the maku frayne has inherited this strength from his grandfather 7
 this was the worst thing i could have said
 brassnose turned a stricken face toward me and said brokenly sommers you meddling yank you're a fool! they despise males who brag of their strength; they destroy such men with their damned tests 4
 you've ruined me blast you!   at first i thought he was out of his head talking wildly like this
 but a glance at songau and the other women confirmed what brassnose had blurted out
 the women's faces had hardened after my statement 9
 at a nod from songau four lithe and muscular girls darted to frayne's side and seized him by the arms
 the man was an ox and he put up a creditable struggle; but four eromonga women are more than a match for the strongest male that ever lived
 besides terror had sapped some of frayne's vitality and will 7
 my last impression as they led him off to a stockade was of his pale face   in the manu tongue eromonga means manhood- a quality which the women derisively toasted in weekly feasts at which great quantities of a brew like kava were imbibed
 in the hut to which i was assigned- max had his own quarters- my food was brought to me by a wrinkled crone with bare drooping breasts who seemed to enjoy conversing with me in rudimentary phrases
 her name was l'turu and she told me many things
 for an anthropologist loquacious old l'turu was a mine of information
 though i had a great dread of the island and felt i would never leave it alive i eagerly wrote down everything she told me about its women
 from l'turu i heard that until about 1850 the people of this island- which was about the size of guam or smaller- had been of both sexes and that the normal family life of melanesian tribes was observed here with minor variations
 but in the middle of the last century an island woman named karipo seized a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rallied the women after their men had fled
 miraculously karipo and her women had succeeded in driving a hundred invaders from the isle of pamasu back to their war canoes after considerable loss of life on both sides
 karipo was something of a politician as well as a militarist 10
 she quickly exploited the exalted position she now occupied by harassing the disorganized males and even putting many of them to death
 within a decade or less few men were left and a feminist society had sprung up
 karipo was great goddess told our mothers that men were not necessary except to father children the crone told me 5
 all men went away from here
 those who stayed had to pass tests
 she cackled with mirth showing the stumps of betel-stained teeth
 karipo's women then named this place 'eromonga'- manhood- for just the strongest men could stay here
 the old woman arose stiffly and led me to a clearing where a small hut stood
 in the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling i saw four figures in a semi-circle on the ground
 i guess he spent the morning getting himself all organized then headed for home
 maybe to beat up on his squaw
 benson looked up and saw ramey's long head tilt forward to rub his chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib
 ramey reached out with the tire iron and dislodged a chunk of mud that was caked on the spare tire rack
 i'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't understand the liquor or automobiles
 somehow the thought of a simp le man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand moved the driver 6
 for a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless drivers softened
 maybe the indian wasn't too much at fault ramey thought 7
 maybe he was only doing the best he knew how like any of us 10
 anyway he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be stared at
 ever see yourself spread out on the pavement benny? 11
  he said to his partner
 you mean dream? 24
  not exactly
 benson grinned and flipped a rock with his thumb like a marble
 nope just you all the time- sometimes i think it's the only way i'll ever get a decent partner
 ramey smiled but he thought to himself i always see me too 7
 whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out thoughts in his own mind
 then he would realize they were really things that only he himself could think
 with this realization sometimes he saw himself as he looked down 8
 you seen him yet? 20
  benson said referring to the indian
 he wasn't in the car ramey said
 you didn't go clear around benson said
 if you want to see something he's back on the other side by the trunk of the car
 too long a waiting line ramey answered pretending to joke 8
 a few minutes later the insurance man a road checker drove up in the gray coupe with license plates on it from a far-away state 9
 it was a trick they used to try and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their speed
 sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar on the trucks as they passed
 all the drivers knew about the plates and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping cane
 horsely an agent on the east end wore the hat trying to look like a tourist
 it had always seemed strange to ramey that to disguise himself as a tourist an ex-truck driver like horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head
 the insurance man informed them that he had talked to crumley who was all right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they towed the rig back to town
 he chatted with ramey and benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer
 every so often the diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down f or the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear
 when they were ready to leave benson and ramey walked back around the rear of the trailer
 there's a body you won't mind looking at benson said and they stopped
 she had driven up with her husband in a convertible with eastern license plates although the two drivers knew nothing at the moment about that
 she wore shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt 15
 slender and tanned her dark brown hair was drawn straight back simply
 what outfit does she drive for? 13
  benson said
 seeing her caused a lurch in ramey a recognition
 she might have been someone he had once loved
 he had never seen her before but now he thought of the manner in which he and benson went in and out of the cities at each end of their run
 the truck routes the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city and they could never stay
 how would you ever see her again? 11
  the feeling subsided it was only a small yearning 10
 what's she doing in this bunch? 7
  benson said and ramey wondered how close their thoughts might have been
 the girl looked around at the countryside
 her glance swung past the trailer where the two drivers were standing
 it made only a tiny bump over the two men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on
 she began to watch a blonde-haired man also in shorts standing right at the rear of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured slightly
 what had caught his attention was obscured by the car itself so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see but benson knew what it was
 the girl took a couple of steps toward the man in shorts when benson in that barefoot courtliness ramey could never decide was real said you don't want to go around there ma'am
 the girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge that someone had spoken to her
 the man stood near the bent levi-clad body of the indian who lay face down almost under the car
 the two drivers moved closer
 what does he want a spoon? 16
  benson said to ramey
 one tiny detail in a happening can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain
 with ramey it was a dusty work shoe that was half-off the indian's foot that he would always remember
 the laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets but there was still a bow knot at the top
 the slightest twitch would have parted the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toes were still inside
 the two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed man 8
 he wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v at the neck the sleeves pushed above the elbows
 he turned and looked at them with clear blue eyes immaculate eyes 8
 he was very tanned- big hands might have torn him from a coca-cola poster
 he's dead isn't he? 10
  the man said
 he turned and bent over the body of the indian 10
 there was nothing in particular on the man's face 19
 it was simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine 11
 what's this? 10
  the man said backing up a step still looking down 9
 his words were mostly to himself
 there was a gentle concern in benson's voice 16
 ramey looked down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded blood-flecked substance lying by itself on the pavement
 but what is it? 21
  the man said with a tone of impatience
 but what is it? 21
  the man had spoken only once
 ramey heard the words again inside weakened the way moving water sounds through a grove of trees until he was not sure whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears
 the sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and ramey's vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's leg
 ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown skin 6
 he stared at the shining shining circles of hairs and heard the voice of his partner through trees don't do that fella 7
 the man seemed to sink a little as ramey brought the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde head was turning as he hit the man again with his fist
 ramey swung and caught the man just to the left of his mouth 8
 it was a straight solid once- in-a-lifetime shot; he laid all four knuckles in between the man's cheekbone and his chin 7
 ramey's fist and the air expelled from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like cupped hands clapping together 7
 the man took two short steps backward then sat down heavily on the pavement
 ramey heard a cry from the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand
 as he watched the man sit suddenly a detached part of his mind observed how very difficult it was really to knock a man off his feet
 he hadn't done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard
 with a thoughtful look the man sat on the pavement legs straight out in front of him
 his arms hung like empty shirt sleeves and his mouth was slightly open
 after what seemed several seconds the open mouth grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it
 the man brought one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he touched his mouth
 he moaned and pulled the hand away
 even yet there was no realization in his eyes 10
 ramey could hear the crowd coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his shoulder had no identity or importance to him
 he did not look around
 he's hurt! a woman's voice said and then he heard a sort of wail from the man's wife
 the man on the ground began to move; one of his hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him
 blood dripped down the front of his sweater soaking into a dark streak of dirt that ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder as though the bright v woven into the neckline had melted running a darker color
 the girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back 9
 can you hear can you talk to me? 9
  she begged
 an incoherent puzzled sound came from the red mouth 9
 the girl looked around quickly at several of the people 11
 none of the crowd had stepped forward to help 11
 then she saw ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment 9
 why did you do it- why did you hit him? 8
  she said her voice rising
 a shine in her eyes suddenly became tears and she turned back to her husband again
 behind ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers 9
 no one seemed to know for sure what had happened nor was there any purpose or responsibility in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver beyond finding out
 ramey looked around and caught sight of his partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman
 benson moved his arms gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and talking rapidly
 ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man 10
 some of the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at ramey
 it's all over now the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward them
 ramey watched him coming with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer
 he saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and rolled at the side of his stocky body the sun left a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of his pistol
 all right step back! the patrolman said to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis
 he walked straight up to the man sitting on the ground and bent over to look at him
 you all right? 19
  mough- it's my mough the man said trying to talk without moving his lips
 his brown face looked gray from dirt streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across it
 then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair the eyes dead on him as the life finally went out of the brute 7
 the body continued to lash but now keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome bloody mass out of the bungalow 6
 he slammed the door and listened as his servants ran up alarmed at the sound of the shots
 he heard their chattering and then the sounds of hacking as they dismember ed the snake right on the porch with wood axes
 it was only then that he turned to look at penny 21
 she was sitting on the edge of the bed again back in the same position where the snake had found her
 the fear had not entirely gone from her face but there were some other emotions now crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth
 but her hands were calm now
 she's got guts thought keith
 she's got more guts than any other woman in the world 5
 keith said penny keith you were wonderful
 i don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving her life but i am
 he smiled at her sincerity
 and for the hundredth time that week he was startled at her beauty
 seven years they'd been married
 he knew her mind pretty well by now its quick perceptions and sympathies its painful insistence on truth and directness its capacity for love almost too deep for a man to reciprocate even in part 6
 but her beauty always surprised him anew
 i realize that this is hardly the time to say it penny said keith
 but knowing you i know that you're glad to be alive and grateful- and sorry because i killed the snake even though i had to 7
 isn't that so? 5
    penny lowered her eyes
 yes she said almost in a whisper as if admitting to a crime 6
 the snake was beautiful wasn't it? 13
  asked keith his voice getting harsher in spite of himself as he struggled to control his growing anger
 it was a king cobra the largest you ever saw and it deserved to live out its life in the jungle didn't it? 9
  didn't it? 12
  penny did not answer
 now she just sat there looking at him without an expression except concern for him
 we're all god's creatures aren't we? 7
  keith was snarling now
 all of us- every goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle
 you love this village and these stinking brown people because they're god's creatures too
 and you love ahmiri that black bastard of a servant even a little more because he's a beautiful man
 and he loves you because you're a beautiful woman 10
 we're all god's creatures aren't we penny? 7
  all of us that is except me
 you hate me you hate my guts because i like to hunt 11
 you actually hate me- and we both know it- because i killed that filthy snake
 h well why don't you say something? 12
    penny would not rise to his mood
 there isn't anything left to say is there keith? 12
  she softly let herself into the bed and took her regular side away from the door where she slept better because keith was between her and the invader
 he knew she was not sulking not even angry at him 13
 just as he knew that she had stopped loving him 12
 the brahmaputra has its headwaters in the tableland of the world the towering white headwalls of the himalayas that are unknown to man as any other space on the planet
 for a brief period each year the rays of the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep at the base of the headwalls and then the pinnacles glisten in the daytime at high noon and billions of gallons of water begin their slow seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys on their long meandering journey to the sea- running east past the sky-carving massifs of gurla mandhata and kemchenjunga then turning south and curling down through the jungles of assam past the khasi hills and into bengal past sirinjani and madaripur until the hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the bay of bengal 4
 keith sterling had looked down on the brahmaputra more times than he could remember during the war days when he flew over the hump of the world thinking it high adventure in those times before man was guiding himself through outer space
 but keith looked down more than up
 he thought of the jungles below him and of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promised himself that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted and animals the lords
 at first it had been just a romantic dream of his the same as the idea of finishing oxford after the war
 but after the war was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself
 wing commanders in the raf do not imply survival in the future either in their orders or in their attitudes to their men or to themselves
 and keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a man paradoxically who might even survive
 he became a fighter pilot after the stint over the hump in the big crates
 the raf was britain's weapon of attrition and flying a fighter plane was the way her sons could serve her best at this point in the war
 he knew how to shoot down nazis
 and he knew that the men talked about him behind his back saying that he was one up on everybody else- including the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was chemically incapable of fear 8
 that was true but only half the truth
 the other half he didn't like to recognize even to himself 11
 not defending england or being an ace or fighting for humanity 7
 and he would have enjoyed it just as much if he had been a nazi
 nowadays we talk as though the blitz were just a short skirmish 6
 the nazis bombed britain so the raf retaliated and shot them all down
 it was a war of nerves of stamina of dogged endurance in which the stupid insistence of the british on their right to their own country became ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazis who were better organized and technically superior
 it took a long time before the british tipped the balance 17
 keith learned too much about air combat and air killing to be risked
 they grounded him and put him in the command offices 11
 that was where he met penny
 he was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking american wac a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work in the command offices but that was all
 penny knew him better on her part
 he had a war reputation but this was the kind of man women like even without medals
 they don't go for bull-like muscle as a rule 5
 he had strength in his six-foot frame but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier
 he was on the thin side with big hands and the kind of wrists that give away the power in forearm and bicep
 his hair was black already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom the only one permitted to a man
 the pretty little twittering wacs said he had the look of eagles- and penny hating the cliche had to admit that in this case it applied
 penny and keith had no romance
 but they met in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly
 the command offices were in the border country up north where the radar systems centralized their intelligence reports and the fighters were dispatched to harry the enemy
 the nazis knew this of course and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers they let a few drop every time they went over hoping for a lucky hit
 this time they had been lucky
 the command post was underground and well camouflaged 10
 but there hadn't been enough time to build it for keeps 14
 there was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and ceiling but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that concrete is not much better than prayer if as efficacious when a direct hit comes along
 this one was actually more of a near miss
 the bomb plunged into the ground near the post but not precisely into the command room itself
 there was a shattering cracking sound as the concrete started to buckle the air filled with dust and flying debris and everyone in the room- men and women hit the floor and used the desks as turtlebacks as ordered
 that is everyone but keith and penny
 they stood there just the two of them in the rocking shattering blast
 keith was on his feet because he didn't care at all about life any more: penny on her feet proudly because she cared too much 5
 the bomb was a solitary one
 the blast damaged but did not destroy the room
 keith's eyes met penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction
 and as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks and tend to those wounded and mark the several killed he climbed across the debris to penny and took her hand in his
 the chaplain married them on the next day 13
 after the war penny had wanted keith at least to visit her home with her
 she came from ohio from what she called a small farm of two hundred acres as indeed it was to farmer- type farmers 7
 but to keith's london-bred mind such acreage sounded rather invincible
 it wasn't that however which decided them not to go to america
 keith told penny about his dream to return to india and burma 7
 he stressed the wild beauty of the mountains and the jungles 11
 he didn't tell her the truth he now freely admitted to himself 5
 that was his true love not penny
 the terrible power of a gun the thing that blasted the soul out of a living body man or beast was one he never wanted to lose 5
 and in the hunting land this hunger was considered to be a noble thing
 when they got to shillong in assam he was happy 10
 this is a paradise for hunters
 this was the land of the sladang the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the spread
 the sambur buck the jungle stag that is even more noble than the scottish elk
 he even hunted elephant although the asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his african cousin
 but there are big rogues in both countries
 these were the ones keith sought out- the loners the ones who killed for the joy of it like himself
 he and penny would go out on tame elephants raised from babyhood in the keddah
 and while he was ever alert for game and most particularly a tiger penny marvelled at the eden they were traversing
 they came upon cheetal deer at woodland pools 12
 peacocks strutted across their path preening
 there were fantastic flowers without perfume and gaudy birds without song
 mouse deer played around the feet of the elephants or fled when the mighty legs thrashed too close
 wild boar watched their progress with little pig eyes and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game worthy of a shot from the 
 now the next morning they were anchored at the elbow and the boat was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms with the weighted line beside it; and robinson roy who had gone down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free dive was already back on the surface
 he and his safety man herr schaffner swam up to the boarding ladder together
 the german courteously indicated that robinson should mount first
 robinson clambered heavily into the boat sat down and stripped off his triple-tank assembly
 he took his mask from his forehead and threw it unexpectedly across the deck
 temper temper mrs forsythe said laughing uneasily 9
 a phony blonde hanging onto a bygone youth and beauty but irreparably stringy in the neck she was already working on her second gin and tonic though it was not yet ten am   i loused it rob said with a savage note in his voice
 all i have to do to set the record is to go on down 13
 so instead i come up
 was it my equipment? 20
  the german asked
 was it something went bad with the breathing? 12
  the equipment was fine rob stated standing up 7
 he was a huge young man of twenty-four clothed in muscle immensely strong with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that was submerged under his present agitation
 he stared stonily at the floor
 i was down to 275
 i've been that far half a dozen times
 i don't get it why this time i should pull such a stupid trick 5
 well i get it artie said still on the ladder
 you are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting a record
 and you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that tells you to turn around before you drown yourself
 no it wasn't that rob said
 a note of awe came into his voice
 when i came up damnit i thought i was going down 13
 i came up maybe fifty feet before i knew what was happening 8
 pressure-happy artie said and climbed in
 i was expecting it sure
 but when it happens to you like that i tell you and you're a hundred feet from where you thought you were- well it makes you think
 you don't head back down again
 not right away
 he had his voice under control again: no one became aware that he was terrified by what had just happened to him
 waddell the newspaperman was a fellow in his middle forties with a graying crewcut heavy-framed glasses and a large jaw padded with fat
 now he was going to show how much he knew
 our boy didn't chicken out no sir
 he ran into the rapture of the depths
 it makes the diver feel drunk
 well that's the only way to be mrs forsythe said and gave her brassy laugh
 maybe not if you're 200 feet under water artie said 8
 it's nothing to fool with
 personally i don't blame him for giving up the dive much as i regret losing the story
 nobody's giving anything up robinson said
 he stood there towering over them all: gentle mighty determined the moving force in the group; and yet like a child among adults
 you think i got you and artie and herr schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride? 7
  i'm going down again
 that's my boy! mr forsythe exclaimed
 rob's not going to give up as easy as all that
 he was a florid puffy man in his early sixties very natty in his yachting cap striped jacket and white flannels
 he went to key west every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know that his title of commodore was never used without irony
 old commodore forsythe who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without accidentally turning on something else first 4
 now it did not occur to him even to wonder whether it was wise for robinson to dive again: rob was his boy the kid he had rescued from the streets the object of his pride
 why he went on when rob asked me if he could make his dive on this trip i didn't think twice about it
 i've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around his brother's tackle shop
 hell i gave him the first decent job he ever had six seven- how many years ago was it rob? 6
  seven years ago commodore rob said impassively 9
 he was thinking big deal: skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven years and no better off than when i started 5
 excuse me he said abruptly
 he went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters; went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him 6
 when you gotta go you gotta go mrs forsythe said 12
 waddell muttered something about taking a look around and climbed up to the flying bridge
 he was disturbed by what had happened on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the night before with the german who had come out of the head while he was fixing himself a drink in the galley
 hi there schaffner he had said
 can i make you one? 13
    no thank you very much schaffner had answered in his accented english
 i do not drink so much thank you
 waddell had looked the man over trying to size him up 6
 he was in his early forties rather short and very compactly built and with a manner that was reserved and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to american ways
 his open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence until one looked into his eyes which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence
 waddell had heard that he had been a commando in rommel's afrika corps and he said to himself: i'd hate to run into him in the desert on a dark night
 aloud he had said making conversation: rob tells me he's using your atlantis equipment on the dive
 yes herr schaffner had said
 he's one hell of a decent boy
 i agree yes
 and if the dive goes ok he has the exclusive import rights to your line for this country is that right? 7
    well no herr schaffner said
 waddell turned to face him
 but that's what he told me
 why that's his main reason for making the dive 8
 shaffner looked at him altogether without guile and shrugged his shoulders making a little spreading gesture with his two hands 6
 what do you mean? 25
  waddell asked frowning
 please let me explain the german said earnestly his face still devoid of deceit
 i have in europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year
 now i wish to enter the american market where the competition is very strong
 i must have a powerful representative here a firm with a national distribution and ten twenty thousand dollars to advertise my products
 with all respect to a fine young man mr roy is not able to provide these necessaries
 waddell was not an eminently moral person but he did not like what he had just heard
 did y ou tell him all this? 10
  he asked
 perhaps not in so many words the german said
 but surely you have misunderstood mr roy
 never never did i offer him the exclusive rights
 we spoke of the need for advertising and i agreed that the deep dive would be most useful for publicity
 he was most eager to make the dive; of course i was willing 9
 but there was no definite agreement about business arrangements 25
 there was the end of his front-page feature story with byline 9
 he started out the door
 one moment! herr schaffner said
 you intend to speak with mr roy? 9
    what else? 20
  waddell asked
 if you will pardon i think it would be better if not 17
 mr roy is determined to make this dive
 whatever you tell him he will dive
 i know this from my talks with him
 well let's let him make up his own mind ok? 7
  waddell said
 on the basis of the facts
 you will make him unhappy and anxious the german said 13
 at 200 300 400 feet under the water when he must be paying very much attention he will be thinking about what you are telling him 6
 it is not good mr waddell: you will do him great harm 17
 there was no doubt that herr schaffner meant every word of what he said
 waddell came back from the door and sat on a bunk 8
 i am an honest man the german said with fervor
 i will give mr roy his due for this dive
 i will make him distributor for all of florida- a big market 9
 all tourists come to florida
 this will help him to get out of his little tackle shop 8
 yes! but there is no use causing him to worry at this time 11
 the german's words worked on the newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty
 he took a big swig of his drink
 it would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like this 12
 i think maybe you're right schaffner he said 15
 he has the distributorship for florida you say? 7
    yes the german said
 at least for south florida
 by god waddell said we don't want to upset the boy at this time of all times
 he sloshed his drink around and drained it in a few large gulps 9
 the story was shaping up nicely in his mind: the young pioneer as of old altruistically braving the unknown; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business america
 join me in another? 11
  he had asked
 thank you the german had said courteously
 i do not drink so much
 now in that same cabin robinson fell to his knees beside a bunk
 fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions
 he pressed his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers in a hurried and anxious whisper
 blessed saint nicholas i thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up instead of down when i was bewildered 7
 and when i make the dive again- he paused; crossed himself; said a hail mary slowly and with understanding
 folding between his hands the cross that hung from his neck he took his appeal direct to headquarters
 holy mary mother of god star of the sea stay thou with me on this next dive
 make it come off all right
 let me set the record this time and let me get back ok so the german will give me the exclusive
 and make my life different and better from this time on 9
 he crossed himself again and rose
 he felt a good deal less shaky
 as he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when he opened he found artie who came in and sat down on a bunk 6
 artie had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger
 he waited awhile before he said roy you know your decompression table don't you? 7
    you know i know it robinson answered warily 15
 you came straight up from 275 without a stop artie said 9
 well i was a little bit confused
 anyway i wasn't down long enough to matter
 you don't see me stretched out on the deck do you? 7
    you know what they say about two deep dives in one day artie went on still twirling the snorkle and studying it intently 7
 i don't think you should go down again
 early that day matsuo saw a marine
 the enemy came looming around a bend in the trail and matsuo took a hasty shot then fled without knowing the result ran until breath was a pain in his chest and his legs were rubbery
 as his feet slowed he felt ashamed of the panic and resolved to make a stand
 he crossed the next meadow and climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed
 in the leafiest part of the tree straddling a broad horizontal limb he could see over the meadow
 for a while he was content to let events develop in their good time
 he had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column and while his shot had probably bred indecision they would soon come hunting
 his superiors had emphasized that marines tortured others for the sheer pleasure
 yesterday; today; tomorrow: no surrender
 his remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only a faint chill of doubt
 he murmured to himself with firmness: no surrender 9
 it was best to die fighting the marines
 his superiors had also preached this saying it was the way for eternal honor
 what if the marines never came? 17
  his comrades were all dead
 then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide 15
 whichever the way he would rot in this vast choking green his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes
 he sighed and leaned for a moment against the trunk 10
 his fingers touched the bone handle of a knife
 the knife an ammunition pouch and a half-filled bottle of purified water hung on his belt
 besides the belt he wore a loin cloth
 as he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer he saw a marine in the jungle across the clearing
 the marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed as though debating whether to brave the sunlight
 his fatigues made a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist
 come out come out in the meadow matsuo said under his breath 6
 the man leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face
 a signal? 17
  matsuo lifted his rifle easing the sling under his left upper arm for steadiness
 fresh on his mind were events of the past day when his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills
 they had fought from caves and the marines resorted to burning them out
 even now like a ringing in his ears he heard the wooooosh of flame-throwers squirting great orange billows
 a wave of flame rippling through their cave had reached nagamo his friend and with a shriek the man bolted through the entrance then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet his uniform blazing 7
 the marines let him advance
 when he sank on his knees they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of mercy
 matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses both the burned and the unburned the latter decomposing rapidly under the tropical sun
 the callous marines had laughed at each other's retching while stacking bodies
 matsuo repeatedly choked down his own nausea
 at nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle reeking of death
 apprehensively he peered to the left to the right into the leafy vine-crisscrossed maze
 he decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow with the one left to distract him
 cautious feet stepping on leafmold; faint creaking of belts and slings; whispers: he heard none of these
 only the hum of insects and the distant fluttering call of a bird
 because he couldn't hear them he was more convinced they were there
 a spectacle occurred across the meadow: the lone marine took a seat on the ground; leaning sidewise on a tree trunk he embraced it 6
 while his comrades cocked the trap that one behaved as if it was some dull maneuver
 taking aim at the man's face matsuo squeezed the trigger up to the point of discharge and then he changed his mind
 he wanted the arrogant marine to know fear and so he aimed above the head
 the shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound 10
 like a mischievous boy expecting punishment matsuo awaited reaction from the jungle
 how stupid to give his position away
 the jungle did not retort
 the sitter remained seated hugging the tree 12
 before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy and insects hummed and birds occasionally called
 matsuo puzzled and grew anxious over the complete passiveness concluding that he was the butt of a devilish joke
 five or so minutes later the marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight immediately throwing his hands over his eyes 5
 he went into a whirling dance a sort of blind chasing of the tail
 it ended when he tumbled; but jumping right up he staggered in no particular direction
 he wore no head cover of any kind and more odd had no visible weapon
 with a sudden decisiveness he lurched in matsuo's direction crossing the meadow in a zigzagging gallop
 when he got closer to the tree matsuo noted the wild look on his face
 the pockets of his jacket bulged
 the bobbing head was a poor target so matsuo shot him in the upper trunk
 the marine spun clapping a hand high on his chest and dived forward
 in the hush that followed the echoes matsuo was tense 13
 they could come on him now without difficulty 10
 gradually he reached a conclusion
 the marine was alone for they were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from the tree
 down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of foliage 8
 the marine was sprawled some thirty yards away one arm extended 7
 matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out
 reflex? 15
  rifle leveled on the man he made a rush
 heat in the sunlight pressed in like an invisible crowd 6
 he squatted by the head gently placing the rifle on the ground
 with a snakestrike motion he grasped the hair and twisting pulled the marine over on his back
 the bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone; around the hole blood glistened in a little patch
 maintaining his clutch on the hair matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in the jacket pockets
 in one: a package of cigarettes and a tinplated lighter both sticky from the man's bleeding
 in the other: a wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief
 one by one he tossed the objects aside
 he didn't smoke and could not light fires with a flintless lighter; he had no use any longer for exact time even had the watch been running
 then there was no saying how many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief
 too bad the marine had no water
 from its holder he took his own canteen
 the cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied pressure
 the marine's eyes opened squeezed shut then opened squinted in the glare
 matsuo put the bottle to his own lips
 the marine reached up a hand
 none for you
 the marine blinked soon dropping his hand
 not only had he no canteen but he lacked even the belt to hang one on
 you came well equipped to die
 some odor made him lean over the man
 he sniffed and recognized it
 so that had been his difficulty
 drunk on sake he must have wandered off from his bivouac 7
 the marine tried to roll on his right side and moaned 7
 when he rolled on the left side propping on his left elbow matsuo seized his hair and pulled him back over
 awkwardly with one hand matsuo got the cap back on the water bottle
 the smell of sake had freshened yesterday's events in his thoughts
 in the caves with other supplies they had kept cases of sake 9
 the marine shut his eyes
 are you a thrower of flame marine? 13
  matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and laid it on the ground out of the marine's reach and away from their shadows 8
 he waited in his squat gripping the hair
 every so often he turned the knife
 its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight
 the sun was noon high and matsuo perspired until his body was dripping
 wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an oily film
 the man had thrown the left hand over his eyes 12
 now and again he murmured something that ended in a giggle 7
 he must have saturated himself in the drink for the bullet not to shock him out of his drunken haze
 at last he reached for the knife
 even the bone handle scorched and he retrieved the marine's handkerchief to wrap it
 first he barely touched the blade on the hand which shaded the eyes
 the marine yelled and flung the hand away 11
 with a firm grip on the man's hair matsuo applied the blade flat on a cheek
 a shrill yelp kicked legs and groping hands that circled matsuo's wrist
 matsuo wrenched free and burned the hands into retreat; burned the other cheek; burned each hand when they came groping again 5
 the marine commenced to weep and it blighted the sense of enjoyment
 a small measure of payment marine
 he dropped the knife in its scabbard hung the rifle behind a shoulder
 the marine hands on cheeks rolled by his unwounded side onto his stomach
 matsuo walked toward his tree once glancing bac k 9
 he would soon die
 as matsuo climbed by using the vines and kicking his feet against the trunk a mood of gloom immersed him like a jungle shadow 7
 what now? 20
  in the jungle birds were mute while insects preserved only the monotony of living
 it was the marine: head lifted he strained and called 12
 then he astonished matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat
 he cupped his mouth and yelled
 matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder
 once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die 10
 it sounded as if the man were calling him: hey japanese h hey there japanese
 the man tilted back his head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container
 he performed the act twice more and the begging in his tone grew more distinct
 the marine nodded vigorously
 matsuo laughed slung the rifle
 the marine was a winehead
 his superiors had said that all marines were depraved 9
 the marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before an idol
 remembering his own thirst matsuo took out his water bottle 8
 one swallow was all he would have; he was very thirsty but he must observe water discipline
 his years of campaigning had taught him the value of water discipline
 he began to uncap the bottle the rusty cap squealing on its threads
 popping upright the marine waved both hands and shouted 8
 of course it was water he really craved; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out
 the marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack
 he had no water for an enemy
 and when this was gone he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool 8
 he capped the bottle and replaced it
 after all he had less reason to desire it than the marine 10
 before much longer the marine quieted down
 the upper part of his packet had stained dark 11
 there is nothing for you matsuo said
 your superiors will certainly beat you for your desertion besides the dishonor of it
 from the convulsive quivers of the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping
 he reminded matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in china
 in china it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform smudged blood-specked with the village burning about him and shells exploding 6
 chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar
 only blue throat and his gang stayed where they were 7
 blue throat was slumped with his back against the bar elbows supporting his massive frame
 he leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed 7
 since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town boys? 8
  he asked
 seems to me i don't remember altering any law about that 7
 he straightened up alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer 7
 stay right here where you are kid he called
 i don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when i'm a-drinking: the stranger ignored him
 he didn't stop till he was within three feet of blue throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver
 i'm billy tilghman said the stranger and i've come for pat conyers' body
 and what makes you think you're going to get it pretty boy? 13
    because i'm asking
 most of the time i get what i ask for
 blue throat winked at his six cronies
 the kid has no manners boys
 shall we teach him some? 8
  his gun was half drawn when he asked the question but the weapon never left its holster
 tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin
 his head snapped round and he reeled back crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling
 tilghman leapt on to him dragged him upright and hit him again this time sending him careening against the bar
 a bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from tilghman's stomach as blue throat's henchmen started shooting 7
 tilghman flung himself aside dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun
 the colt roared twice and two men dropped writhing 10
 a third shot doused the light
 somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled you all right billy? 12
    yes george but i ain't got poor old pat's body yet 7
 and i aim to have it
 he fired again and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed 9
 another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor
 and me said another blue throat henchman
 tilghman and his partner george rust herded the men into a corner
 and now said tilghman with deadly calm i'll repeat what i said 8
 i've come for pat conyers' body
 in two minutes the body of tilghman's former comrade who had been killed by blue throat in a gambling brawl the previous night was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial
 blue throat nursing an aching jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride rode out of town with the survivors of the fight
 that critter will be back tomorrow predicted george rust and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him
 blue throat won't stand for this
 he'll shoot up the town
 the reverend james doran had scarcely completed pat conyers' last rites on boot hill in the township of petrie when shots were heard in the distance
 amen said the reverend doran grabbing his rifle propped up against a tombstone and now my brethren it would seem that our presence is required elsewhere
 billy tilghman and his comrades rode off to the battle 8
 blue throat who had ruled the town with his six-shooter for the last six months certainly had no intention of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship
 it was essential that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring ruthless gun-slinger and this was the time-honored wild west method of doing it
 he rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance to main street 7
 the entire length of the street could be raked with rifle fire from this barn
 any posse riding down the street to demand blue throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst of fire 5
 the law-abiding citizens of petrie had gathered inside kaster's store halfway down the street
 several were firing into the barn when billy tilghman arrived 7
 he sized up the situation and shook his head
 if blue throat has his way he'll keep us all cooped up in here for days he said
 there's only one thing to move him fast and we have it right here in this very store
 he called the store owner and together they went in to the stockroom
 billy returned with six sticks of dynamite
 i'm gonna drop these into blue throat's lap he announced and i'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while i get near enough to toss 'em through the window
 he slipped outside hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways
 blue throat's men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts and board walk as he passed
 fifty yards away from the barn he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back
 here he couldn't be seen by blue throat and his gang 7
 all he had to do was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks run to within ten yards of an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through
 billy tilghman did just that
 within seconds the big barn was blasted into smoking splinters with every outlaw either dead or injured inside
 it was the abrupt end of blue throat's dictatorship in petrie 11
 though only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to those parts
 to tilghman the incident was just one of a long list of hair-raising smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old and did not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning a drunk to be quiet
 of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys of the old west uncle billy tilghman stands out head and shoulders
 he was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book
 he saw the most action beat up more badmen with his bare fists broke up the most gangs and sent more murderers to the gallows than any other us marshal who lived before or after him
 for fifty years his guns and ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the west
 the deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified almost to the point of hero-worship but because billy tilghman remained strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the west have remained almost unsung
 citizens took the view that a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of half a century
 he came within an ace of being riddled with bullets during his long fight with the doolin gang which terrorized oklahoma in the 1890's
 led by bill doolin these mobsters specialized in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed banks making liberal use of their guns
 bill doolin's ambition it appeared was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of jesse james and billy the kid and bill tilghman had sworn he would stop him
 tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand- in-glove with the doolin gang
 they bought rustled cattle from the outlaw kept him supplied with guns and ammunition harbored his men in their houses 7
 billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers named ed dunn who lived at rock fort
 on a bitterly cold day in january 1895 accompanied only by neal brown as his deputy tilghman left the township of guthrie and headed for rock fort and dunn's ranch
 it was snowing hard when they got there and they saw no horses outside
 the only evidence of occupation came from the chimney which was belching out thick smoke
 the two lawmen halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door
 wait here neal said tilghman
 if i don't come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse
 leaving his rifle in the wagon tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it
 there was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside
 directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day
 seated near it with his back to the door was the rancher ed dunn
 the rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move 11
 tilghman closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire 6
 suddenly he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck 7
 along each side of the room were six tiered bunks each one screened off with a curtain
 and projecting wickedly through these curtains were the gleaming muzzles of six rifles all trained on billy tilghman 7
 the fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs might slam into his hide
 thinking fast tilghman never hesitated for one instant 9
 he walked right up to the fire as though blissfully unaware of the guns covering him
 the men behind them were bill doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer
 cold day said tilghman placing his hands behind him and casually presenting his backside to the fire
 just dropped in to ask where jed hawkins lives 10
 can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow
 he wouldn't look tilghman in the face
 follow the river for five miles he said hoarsely
 jed's homestead is on the south bank
 resisting the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minutes 5
 all that time rifle barrels were pointing unwaveringly at his head and body
 one false move on his part and he would be a dead man 7
 well he announced guess i'll be going now ed and thanks for the warmup
 he strolled back to the door whistling softly hands still clasped behind him
 he left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace and wondered by what remarkable stroke of providence he had been allowed to come out alive
 but he knew well enough that those guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon
 if he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly 8
 leisurely he climbed on to the wagon next to neal brown 7
 don't say or do anything he said softly
 just get out of here without it looking as though we're in a hurry
 that place is crawling with bill doolin and his gang 10
 even as he spoke those words billy tilghman's life hung on a thread
 back in the house a hoodlum named red buck sore because billy had been allowed to leave unscathed jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right then
 you'll stay right here commanded bill doolin covering red with his rifle
 billy tilghman is too good a man to shoot in the back 7
 but the fighting marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a full and final stop one night in a street at cromwell oklahoma where he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets
 wiley lynn a self-styled prohibition officer had hit town the previous day and had been drinking ever since
 that night he reeled out of ma murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting off his revolver
 for several months now jack carter a big overgrown boy of fifteen with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot of red in them had been haunted by a dream a vision of a woman 6
 this woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she radiated warmth a sweet warmth; she would talk to him in a soothing voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put her hands on him and kiss him passionately
 when she would do these things he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach
 then he would run to the toilet behind the house
 sometimes he did this three or four times a day for this woman was almost always with him
 he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell it on him
 but they never said anything so he figured it was all right 11
 and so when miss langford came to teach at the one-room chestnut school where jack was a pupil in the eighth grade the woman of jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure 5
 he could not keep his eyes off her when at school; when he went home at night he took her with him in his mind and she did the things the anonymous woman used to do and he did the thing afterwards each time as he used to do
 when he awoke in the mornings she was in his mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh 7
 miss langford was an attractive girl
 tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without being heavy she cut a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils in her fresh starched summer dress
 something was beginning to stir and come alive in her too she was twenty now; but if it had been it had been smothered until : you could tell it by the way she watched the older bigger boys like jack 8
 she would look at jack with that hidden something in her eyes and jack would see the woman and become breathless and a little sick 5
 school began in august the hottest part of the year and for the first few days miss langford was ve ry lenient with the children letting them play a lot and the new ones sort of get acquainted with one another
 the first two or three days they went home early
 all that is except jack
 he hung around the schoolhouse watching through a window from outside while miss langford straightened desks and put the room in order
 once she kneeled down to pick up some books where they'd dropped on the floor and jack looked up her dress- at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg
 he thought for a moment his heart had stopped beating 8
 about that time miss langford straightened up and looked out the window directly at him he thought although probably she didn't even see him
 he jumped back ducked and ran crouching down the hill away from the school
 he didn't look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse a nd out of breath; then he slowed to a walk
 the vision became even stronger now
 i'll get her yet he muttered to himself
 i've got to get her
 that night he dreamed a dream violent with passion in which he and the woman now the teacher did everything except engage in the act and when he awoke the next morning his heart was afire 7
 he ate litle that morning and his mother became concerned inasmuch as he usually ate heartily
 what's the matter honey? 8
  she said with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child
 aren't you hungry? 15
    no i'm not hungry he said pushing back the bacon and eggs 7
 outside it was already hot at 7:30 am and it was getting hot in the kitchen
 he felt a little sick at his stomach
 are you sick? 28
    no he said
 i guess it's this hot weather
 don't you play hard today then
 and if you get sick ask the teacher to let you come home early 11
 daddy left the car for me and i'm going to town this afternoon
 o k i won't play hard he promised
 just then charles lever yelled hey jack from the quarry road which ran behind the carter house and jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen door yelling good-bye mom over his shoulder
 whaddya say boy? 15
  charles said grinning showing his huge yellow teeth 7
 charles also fifteen was tall and skinny scraggly with straight black hair like an indian's and sharp brown eyes
 he considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him
 you know what i done last night? 19
  charles said as they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away from the dixie highway through a corn field and a patch of woods to the school
 jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girls were charles' only apparent interest
 but jack always derived vicarious sensual thrills from charles' revelations so he usually invited them as he did now
 what? 19
    i got margaret rider in one of them old box cars down there by the quarry
 a nude imaginary picture of miss langford flashed across jack's mind
 hell you say? 10
  he said lapsing into the profanity he often used when away from his parents and especially when he was with charles 8
 how'd you do it? 9
    hell i jist got on top of-   no i mean how'd you get her to do it? 6
    hell i jist ask her
 jist like that? 15
    hell yes
 she's been hangin' around me a lot here lately and i figgered i might as well's try it
 besides i heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it
 it's all over branchville
 if you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even get her your ownself
 i might try it one of these days jack said wonderingly thinking of miss langford
 when they reached the school a gang of boys and girls were already there playing crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse 6
 miss langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals without socks was out there with them trying to get them inside 7
 time for books she yelled jingling a little five-and-dime store bell in her right hand
 oh come on miss langford play with us just onct one of the little girls begged smiling wistfully
 no not now said the teacher
 come inside now
 the children grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse
 jack watched miss langford all morning
 he could think of nothing else save his mental image of her nude figure and what charles had said that morning about margaret rider 6
 occasionally he would look across the aisle at margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress sitting in the sixth-grade row and he coud hardly believe she would do what charles had said she did 5
 at noontime remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the kids jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys except charles went off out the road to play ball 5
 why ain't you playin' ball? 15
  he asked charles suspiciously as they sat in the well-house shade watching the girls congregate in front of the schoolhouse 7
 miss langford come out and play with us like you promised several of the little girls called
 i'd druther stay here and watch the girls charles grinned 5
 maybe some of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress
 maybe jack said idly watching for miss langford 7
 presently she came out of the schoolhouse
 when she appeared two or three of the little girls jumped up and down yelling goody goody
 let's play with 'em jack said rising from where he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants
 ok charles rose also and the two of them moved over to join the girls
 they played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap 11
 then when miss langford was on the end of the line of girls jack in the middle of the line gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards sitting down hard her dress flying over her head
 while she was struggling to get her skirt down and get on her feet again jack ran over offered her his hand and said gosh i'm sorry miss langford
 i didn't mean to pull so hard
 that's all right she said tossing her head back to get the hair out of her eyes
 with one hand she held her skirt down while she took jack's extended hand with the other
 when her hand touched his fire went through jack and he felt weak but he managed somehow to get her on her feet
 he thought she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand go
 thank you she said dusting herself off
 will you play with us again miss langford? 8
  one of the little girls said
 maybe some other day
 oh shucks the girl said
 i don't believe i'll play any more neither
 me neither others said and soon the game broke up the children going off in pairs in larger groups and alone
 jack walked off alone out the road in the searing midday sun past robert allen's three-room tarpapered house toward the field where the other boys were playing ball thinking of what he would do in order to make miss langford have him stay in after school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw the look in her eyes 4
 when he came back to the schoolhouse his mind was made up 15
 he simply would not work his arithmetic problems when the teacher held his class
 that should do it he thought because miss langford had said she was going to be strict about school work
 he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities: the teacher probably would make him stand face- to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school
 the only drawback now to the plan he'd decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work too and the teacher would have that person stay late along with jack
 but i've got to take a chance on it he told himself desperately 6
 to his surprise his plan worked perfectly
 all right if you can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school it out miss langford said firmly not smiling 6
 you will stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and work your problems
 and so when the others stampeded out that afternoon jack remained docilely in his seat near a window looking out in what he hoped was a pitiable manner while the other kids laughed and yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed going home
 his heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was trying to think his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened child how will i do it? 6
  on the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise
 she munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck
 the youth with the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman
 lithe and muscular he had well-molded features and his light color told of the european ancestors who had been intimate with the slave women of his family
 the haughty white girl turned to a distinguished hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured: look at your watch col garvier 5
 it is almost time for and calinda to begin 20
 col henri garvier was one of new orleans' most important and enlightened slave owners
 he chuckled and gave the signal for the dance to start 10
 the slaves ran gaily to the center of congo square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called johnny no-name
 johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer bones against the gourd which served as his drum
 he showed his gleaming tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently his brass earrings jangling discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy
 the drummer flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners and their disciples in the louisiana slave compounds
 the dance was of haitian origin
 the white girl with the penetrating green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of about 30 who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows
 he was possessive in his manner and though a slave obviously was educated after a fashion and imitated the manners of his owners 6
 he proudly wore the blue livery of her house for the girl was madame delphine lalaurie wife of the prominent surgeon dr louis lalaurie who bore one of the south's oldest and most cherished names 6
 delphine was a pace-setter in high society
 she was a top horsewoman and one of the city's most gracious hostesses
 although new orleans was not to learn of it for a spell she also was a sadist a nymphomaniac and unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against humanity ever committed on american soil
 madame lalaurie gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders
 the slender handsome fellow was called dandy brandon by the other slaves
 he was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure for women of any race
 but dandy had had little experience with girls on his master's plantation in bayou st john
 shy actually he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in the open fields in carriages and in boathouses 6
 this young slave was therefore quite unprepared when delphine lalaurie signaled that she wanted him to draw near
 the woman eyed the youth with the avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is not yet in his collection
 what is your name boy? 15
  come a bit closer
 i won't bite you know
 he gaped at madame lalaurie and sniffed the paris perfume which emanated from her
 my name is dandy brandon missy
 i belong to master alexander prieur
 she said with intense feeling: come near let me feel your arms 8
 you look quite strong and healthy to me dandy
 mrs lalaurie impatiently propelled the slave toward her waiting carriage
 lifting her skirts she climbed in never relinquishing her grip on his arm
 the woman seemed utterly unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor
 once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau she drew the curtains and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination usually reserved for army inductees
 satisfied at last and after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced delphine that dandy was capable of learning new arts she opened the window and called to her liveried driver
 this was the big man with the proprietory air and the beetling shaggy eyebrows
 aristide! i want you to find monsieur prieur at once and give him this money for the boy's purchase
 there's $600 in gold in this chamois sack
 if the old fool argues about the price tell him i shall order my husband not to treat him as a patient any longer
 prieur has gout and depends on louis' pills and bleedings 8
 besides he owns 300 slaves
 one less shouldn't matter to him
 aristide devol the sardonic manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native sierra leone smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver hat
 his bold eyes raked the woman and a perceptive spectator might sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to owner
 another youth madame? 12
  the coachman said softly
 this one is a tender chicken oui? 10
  such delicate beauty such fine flesh
 it will rip and shred easily for madame
 be quiet devol! you are forgetting your plac e 12
 the tall coachman walked off briskly in search of alexander prieur
 delphine lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove dandy brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion at 677 perdido street
 dr louis lalaurie stood on the veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached the pillared mansion 6
 dandy curiosity overcoming his apprehensions peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle
 he saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large head
 dr lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket and his myopic eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses
 he was about 50 years old
 another young man my dear? 11
  really you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself he said frowning with displeasure
 delphine presented her cheek for a kiss and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster
 dandy is to be our house guest louis
 i want the room in the attic prepared for him he is a most unusual lad quite precocious in many ways
 he deserves a better life than just rotting away on the prieur plantation
 his room will be ready shortly
 the physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory glance at the cringing slave
 had dandy been older or wiser instinct might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the lalauries' tender care if he valued his life
 but he liked the smell of delphine's perfume 13
 besides her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth
 also he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony 7
 so dandy brandon trustingly entered the house with delphine lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to be his new home
 airless and dingy though it was the attic represented luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at bayou st john
 he bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted when madame lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber 6
 it was just as well that the ignorant dandy enjoyed himself to the hilt that first evening for the room was to become his prison cell 6
 when he finally left the sinister mansion on perdido street he was carried out in a coroner's basket
 just six weeks after dandy brandon's arrival at the mansion the little surgeon and his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball to which only new orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited
 a stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms and delphine circulated graciously among her guests chatting airily of the forthcoming races the latest fashions from paris and louisiana politics
 suddenly there was a commotion upstairs a despairing boyish shriek and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase 5
 it was dandy brandon clad only in a bloody loincloth emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him
 the lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts 6
 his pinched face showed the ravages of malnutrition 10
 feebly he pointed an accusing finger at madame lalaurie and shouted: evil woman! you did this h you like to hurt h to beat people h i want h to go home
 these were the last words he ever uttered
 convulsively he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of senator gaston berche crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician wore
 dr louis lalaurie examined the inert form of the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead
 the ball broke up in confusion
 guests stared with horror at madame lalaurie and made speedy departures
 delphine stood like stone her eyes alive with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse
 but at the coroner's inquest delphine told a forthright story 11
 i saw the boy dandy at the congo square festivities and felt sorry for him
 it was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom when the right time came for he was a bright and friendly youth who seemed worthy of our interest
 after i paid monsieur prieur for dandy i brought him home but he was ill at ease and ran away the same night
 how he returned in such a ghastly condition or why i cannot say 10
 dr lalaurie and i didn't even know he was in the house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs
 she daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said with obvious emotion: that poor boy! he must have fallen in with evil companions for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and inexperienced
 ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing him back to our house to die
 such a pitiful end!   though the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's panel dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury and disregarded
 the lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity of so illustrious a lady
 moreover runaway slaves frequently got into serious trouble in new orleans' dives
 so the verict was death at the hands of a person or persons unknown and the elite of the city accepting delphine's testimony welcomed her and the doctor back into the fold
 once again life went its serene way- soirees fox hunts balls and dinners
 the excitement over brandon's bizarre death abated and madame lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital
 then on july 2 there occurred another incident which set tongues to wagging at a furious clip
 mrs victor dominique socially prominent and a neighbor of the lalauries chanced to glance out of her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight
 the manservant devol and his mistress delphine lalaurie were pursuing a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front lawn of the lalaurie mansion
 the girl was not more than 16
 she was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not conceal the knife slashes on her back
 the bleeding girl was tiring fast; the coachman and delphine were gaining on her as she raced down perdido street
 the fugitive cried out in an oddly sibilant voice: help me somebody! they have pulled out all my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw! bastards he would say all i did was put a beat to that vivaldi stuff and the first chair clobbered me! since then and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and even indecent- group from greenwich village to the embarcadero he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper
 there ain't nothin' faster or lonelier or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace feathertop would say 6
 the accommodations may not be the poshest but man! there ain't nobody askin' for your ticket stub neither
 he had been conning the freights for a long long time now 12
 ever since the hooch and the trouble with the quartet and midge and the child
 it had been a very long time that had no form and no end 11
 he was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own- riding the dark train out
 out and out and never to return again
 till one day the last freight had been jumped the last pint had been killed the last beat had been rapped
 that was the day it ended
 the freight car was cold early in the morning 11
 he was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina
 he held his elbows away from his body and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly 7
 the train slowed at a road crossing and the big door slid open; at first gratingly caught by grains of corn- then with a clash into its slot
 the boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor
 she pulled her legs up under her to rise her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs and feathertop's music pffft-ed away 5
 now that is a very nice a very nice he murmured to himself back in his corner
 a little thing but the right twist for the action that counted 6
 hot that was the word hot! hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's wings with the sun shining down over them
 a poet yet! his thoughts for the swanlike neck the full high breasts the slim waist and the long legs were less than poetic however 5
 zingggg-o! then the boy straight-armed himself up twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting
 he was less to see but feathertop took him in too just to keep the records straight
 curly hair high cheekbones wide gnomelike mouth a pair of drummer's blocky hands and a body that said well maybe i can wrestle you for ten minutes- but then i'm finished
 we made it cappy the chick said
 yeah seems so don't it the boy laughed hugging her close 7
 ah-ah! feathertop interrupted standing up brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants
 we run a respectable house here
 they whirled and saw him standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall
 he was big and filthy and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes
 he held the black plastic kazoo lightly
 come sit said feathertop motioning them toward him 9
 that crap is softer over here
 the girl smiled and started forward
 the boy yanked her back hard tugging her off her feet and gathered her into the crook of his arm
 now stay with me kitty he snapped irritably 11
 i vowed to take care of you- and that's what i'm gonna do 7
 we don't know this guy
 oooo square bit feathertop screwed his face up
 this guy was strictly from outsville
 but nowhere!   what is with this vow jazz? 10
  feathertop inquired lounging against the freight's vibrating wall
 we- we eloped cappy said
 his head came up and he said it defiantly
 feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand 6
 these two were going to be easy pickins
 they couldn't have much dough but then none of the freight-bums feathertop rolled had much
 and besides the chick had a little something the others didn't have
 that was gonna be fun collecting!   but not just yet 9
 he liked to savor his meat before he tasted it 13
 come sit he repeated motioning to the piled hay bags over the pig leavings
 i'm just a poor ex-jazz man name of- uh- boyd smith 4
 he grinned at them wolfishly
 that ain't your name mister the boy accused 11
 and you know- you're right! feathertop aimed a finger at him 6
 oh come on cappy the girl chided
 she started to move toward the hay bags dragging the reluctant cappy behind her
 feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim trim legs as she walked to the bags and tucked them beneath her smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle
 he cleared his throat; it had been a long hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance 6
 he had it all doped of course
 slug the kid grab his dough- at least enough to get to philadelphia- and then have a rockin' ball with the doll 5
 hmm- diddle!   where'd you come from mr- uh- mr smith? 8
  kitty inquired politely
 out
 i been riding train for a ways now
 they lapsed into silence and the freight wallowed up a hill scooted down the other side shaking and clanking to itself 8
 after a while kitty murmured something to cappy and he held her close answering we'll just have to wait till we pull into philly honey
 what's the matter she wanna go the bathroom? 7
  ernie found it immensely funny
 the boy scowled at him and the girl looked shocked 12
 no! certainly not i mean no that isn't what i said! she snapped at him
 i only said i was hungry
 we haven't had anything to eat all day
 joviality suffused feathertop ernie cargill's voice as he reached behind him pulling out a battered carpet bag with leather handles
 whyn't ya say so fellow travelers! why we got dinner right here 6
 c'mon buddy help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two
 cappy looked wary but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar 5
 ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag
 he took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal a deep pot of thin metal some sheets of newspaper a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it 5
 he put the charcoal in the pot lit the paper with the matches and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot 9
 a charcoal pit man he said indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier
 fan it he told cappy handing him a sheet of newspaper 8
 yeah but what're we gonna eat? 7
  charcoal? 19
    fella ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man you try my ever-lovin' patience
 he reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners
 not the greatest but they stick to your belly insides 8
 he ripped down the cellophane carefully and laid three dogs on the tin foil
 almost immediately they began to sizzle
 he looked up and grinned
 a kroger's self-serve he explained
 when they had licked the last of the wieners' taste from their fingers they settled back and cappy offered ernie a cigarette 8
 nice kid ernie thought too bad
 how come you're riding the rods kids like you? 9
  ernie asked
 cappy looked down at his wide hands and did not reply 8
 but surprisingly kitty's face came up and she said my father 8
 he didn't want us to get married
 why didn't he want you to get hitched? 10
  this time even she did not answer
 she looked down at her hands too
 after a few seconds she said dad didn't like cappy 12
 cappy's head came around sharply
 your fault hell! it was all my fault
 if i'd been careful it never woulda- he stopped abruptly 8
 what's the matter? 15
    the girl still did not raise her eyes but she added simply i'm pregnant
 oh he was stupid her old man! you never heard nothin' like it: kitty's gonna go have an abortion and kitty's gonna go away to a convent and kitty's this and kitty's that h like he was nuts or somethin' y'know? 6
    ernie nodded
 this was a slightly different matter
 he remembered midge and the child
 but that had been a time before all this a time he didn't think about
 a time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out
 but these kids weren't like him
 oh crap! he thought pull out of it old son
 these are just another couple of characters to roll 11
 what they got you get
 now forget all this other
 wanna drink? 12
  ernie offered taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket
 the answer came from the open door of the boxcar 11
 from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside as the train had slowed on the grade
 ernie stared at the man
 real big with shoulders out to here and hair all over him like a grizzly
 you gonna give me a drink fella? 11
  the big man asked again taking a step into the boxcar 10
 this character could break him in half
 sure he said and lifted the pint to his own lips
 he guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder
 the man stalked toward them his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring
 he took the bottle with undue belligerence and making sucking noises with his thick lips drained it completely
 he threw his head back closed his eyes and belched ferociously 10
 he belched again and opening his eyes threw the bottle out the open door
 well now he said and reached into his pocket
 i didn't know i was gonna have company in this car 5
 we're going to philadelphia kitty said pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more
 no i don't think so said the big man and it was the final clincher for ernie
 he had suspected this guy was trouble and now he was sure of it 7
 maybe you and me will girlie but these two ain't goin' nowhere 7
 he advanced on them and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car
 ernie was screaming inside himself: no damn you you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me! the newcomer stalked toward them and kitty shied back her hand to her mouth
 her scream split up the silence of the car accompanied by the rattling of the freight and then cappy came off the floor his legs driving him hard
 the kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump! and carried him backward in a footballer's tackle
 they went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs
 the kid showed for an instant and his arm was cocked back 7
 the fist went down into the pile of flesh and ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go aaawww! then they were tumbling again and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier and came up with a vicious switchblade
 he held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough to press the stud
 the blade came out with a snick! he fisted the knife overhand and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat
 kitty screamed insanely and her face was white
 she grabbed at feathertop's sleeve and shrieked help him! help him! do something! they neither liked nor disliked the old man 7
 to them he could have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and after mass and at noon and at six each evening- its tone repetitive monotonous never breaking the boredom of the streets
 the old man was unimportant
 yet if he were not there they would have missed him as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early june; or the smell of thick tomato paste- the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth
 or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights
 or the bay of female dogs in heat
 they never called him by name although he had one 10
 filippo rossi that's what he was called in the old country; but here he was just signore or the old man
 but this was not unusual because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders
 it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession
 but youth asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing
 the only thing unusual about the old man had long since happened
 but the past was dead here as the present was dead 11
 once the old man had had a wife
 and once she too ignored him
 with a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders she wiggled her satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop 6
 in one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase
 the way she strutted down the street the old man would have been blind not to have noticed both
 without looking at him without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of her she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars rode away in it and never came back 7
 but she shouldn't have come here in the first place the women had said
 she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from torino
 eh torino! she gave herself fancy airs! just because she had a part on the stage in the old country she thought she could carry her head higher than ours
 they had slapped their thighs
 it's not for making pretty speeches about dante those actresses get paid so good
 henh! calloused fingers caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted never to be tweezed away
 mauve-colored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled but had condemned again and again
 puttana! but if the old man even thought about his wife now nobody cared a fig
 it was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance as thin as the seams on her stockings and still thinner
 his voice had not commanded her to stop
 it had not questioned why
 the women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him
 and his eyes- those miniature sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression or direction
 the old man's very soul could have left him and flown down that street but he wouldn't have had anyone know it
 perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife
 but when he called for his withered wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar? 8
    there seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to drexel street and his back in opposition to the church behind him
 for all he saw or cared to see this could have been a town in italy not the outskirts of philadelphia
 it could have been bari or chieti for the way it smelled 12
 what did it matter to him that the park at the foot of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals? 6
  or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the schuylkill? 6
  this place was hatred to him just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness
 to him they were one and the same
 sameness for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city
 sameness lined the streets with two-story houses the color of ash
 it slashed the sloping manure-scented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches
 it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors
 even the stable-garage which housed nothing now but the scent of rot had a lawn before i t
 and the coffee shop on drexel street where the men spent their evenings and sundays playing cards had a rose hedge beneath its window 5
 the hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it 10
 only one house on the street had no lawn before it 8
 it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade
 above it from a second-story showroom wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood
 did the old man remember them there? 10
  yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks- like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery
 only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences where one man's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy
 love and hatred and fear were one here shaded only by fig trees and grape vines
 and the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch
 the old man silently fed upon these streets
 they kept him alive waiting
 waiting for what and for whom only he could tell and would not 6
 it was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself but it was not yet time to pay the price
 he was holding out for something
 he was determined to hold out
 the old man's son threw himself down belly first upon a concrete step taking in the coolness of it and dreaming of the day he would be rich
 at fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother that he couldn't remember her face or her touch; neither did he care that aunt rose provided for him
 he was named pompeii as a tribute to his heritage and he couldn't have cared less about that either
 to him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep
 when he would be a man he would be a rich man 16
 he would not be like the rich americans who lived in white-columned houses on the other side of the park
 he would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning 12
 he would not carry a brief case
 nor would he work at all
 he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step
 he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running bowing with her running calling out in her bowing at your service
 he would order her to bring coffee and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would not remove his gloves- and light and smoke
 he could do that when he would be a man
 hey laura! he called to his sister on the porch above the steps
 she was only ten months older than he
 laura what would you say if i smoked a pipe? 7
    laura did not answer him
 she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence brushing and drying her wet gilded hair in the sun
 one lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before th e creaking torn pales
 her tanned foot whose arch swept high and white pointed artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers whose tips glowed white
 all the while she sat there her sinewy arms swirled before her chest
 her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii
 it was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours
 the eyes blue and always somewhat downcast possessed a sullen quality
 even though the boy could not see them he knew they were clouded by distance
 he was never sure they fully took him in 15
 pompeii called again laura! but the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it 5
 she's in a mood he thought there's not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood
 well what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about? 6
  and as for his pipe if he wanted to smoke one nobody would stop him
 suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue feasting against the salt taste of him
 above the tongue an aged yellow eye sallow and time-cast encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin stared unfalteringly at him
 christ sake goat git! but the goat would not
 you're boiling milk ain't you? 9
  soothing it with his hand knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch 5
 his head undulated gradually covering space to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats 7
 with his mouth opened wide he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light earthy taste of it
 the boy's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player pressing and pulling delighting in what he did 7
 above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud 7
 its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane 9
 but the boy could see only the goat's belly
 the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him sensing something portentous in it
 he knew it was there knew also what it was about but he wouldn't raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back 7
 there would be time enough perhaps the old man reassured himself to pay the devil his due
 time enough to give up his sou l
 in the meantime six sandals stained an ocher the same color as pompeii's shaved hair edged up close to him
 the clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks 5
 he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to niobe the neatest ones to concetta and the laced ones to romeo concetta's idiot brother
 pompeii expected romeo's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground
 he expected concetta's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy and her shrill impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything 6
 people came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it 9
 the room filled with smoke and maggie's head throbbed with exciteme nt and fatigue but stuart had such a happy earnest look of proud possession on his face that maggie couldn't bear to do anything to quench it
 little anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery 7
 in two months she became a fat highly social baby with a fuzz of flaxen hair all over her head
 she stopped flying into rages and started digesting her food; she developed a peaches and cream complexion and a sunny disposition and she asked for nothing more of life than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity going on around her 4
 she was so heavy that maggie's arms shook from lifting her and taking care of her
 maggie couldn't seem to get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do: there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety old washer and lugged out and lugged back; there was the daily round of household chores in which maggie insisted on participating
 worry had a great deal to do with it; stuart had been laid off at the produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office taking what salary his father could hand out to him 7
 mr clifton would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's upkeep and besides that there were the things that had to be bought for the baby milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap just plain soap
 maggie and stuart pored over figures every night trying to find how they could squeeze out a few pennies more
 in desperation maggie consulted eugenia one afternoon: do you think you could find me something i could do here at home to make some money so i could still watch the baby and do the rest of the things? 6
    it seems to me you have enough to do as it is eugenia said 11
 she had been watching maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to the stove and back again
 i have plenty of odd moments when i could be doing something maggie said
 it would make me feel a lot better but the woman's exchange isn't taking baked goods any more and i can't leave the baby with grandma because she isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery
 i should think so eugenia said
 for one thing you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the skin out nineteen times a day 6
 she's so beautiful and i do like to keep her looking nice 6
 she picked up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck 7
 she'll be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed eugenia said
 evadna mae evans said she didn't put a thing on her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old
 evadna mae evans got all her baby clothes from best's liliputian bazaar in new york and i'm sick and tired of hearing about evadna mae evans
 well now maggie you don't have to snap at me eugenia said 7
 i'm just thinking of a way for you to be sensible 5
 i do seem to snap at everybody these days but i would like to think of a way to make a little extra money
 let's make a list of your assets
 maggie started laughing and she laughed so hard she couldn't stop and she kept on laughing while she lugged the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still shining
 when she came back eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures
 i have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working mothers eugenia said
 we could put up cribs on the second floor sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it's nice and sunny but of course it would entail quite a bit of running up and down stairs and chris said you were to be careful about that
 what else? 20
    you might set up a dress shop in the living room 15
 every woman in the block has tried that
 what about a tea room then? 13
  you could set up tables in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes
 and grandma isn't strong enough to take on something like that and to tell you the truth neither am i
 she said well those are the really interesting things but if you don't like any of those i can turn over some of my extra typing jobs to you if you think you can type well enough
 oh i'm sure i could do that maggie said
 but it really wouldn't be fair taking your jobs away from you 6
 don't worry i can get plenty more eugenia said wondering where in the world she could
 maggie was looking much happier already clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could put up a typewriter right there and be brushing up on her typing so eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it
 and then whenever i have a minute i can be working at it and keep an eye on the baby and the stove at the same time 8
 and i can go back to my contests and be thinking while i'm doing the washing
 what are you going to do with your feet so you don't waste anything? 10
    maggie laughed
 she said oh eugenia i wish h   what? 12
  i wish i had three wishes maggie said
 all of them for you
 it grew bitterly cold toward the end of november contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people
 the temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during the days
 the cold settled like a tangible pall over the mile high city locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and altered its physical appearance; it had a look of grim stark realism resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources 4
 the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices outside newspaper buildings in parks in relief lines outside government agencies
 there weren't facilities to take care of them; there never had been a need felt for such facilities
 that kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the east which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested populations and their greedy centralization of industries protected by discriminatory freight rates
 the east was popularly supposed to have got the country into war and into depression dragging the west along; and now the east was creating government agencies for which the west doubtless would have to pay
 the government offices were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrated everything 8
 shivering people talked and argued; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate remedies and something had to be done
 something had to be done; it was the theme song of millions of american people their personal problems no less urgent than those of the government
 something had to be done
 the abernathys said it to each other a dozen times a day 10
 something had to be done about the furnace the fuel bills the washing machine the doctor and dentist bills about making money stretch for food for the mortgage for taxes for shoes for half soles for overshoes for clothes for the new leaks in the roof for gas and light bills; about keeping warm about keeping well about meeting the minor emergencies that came up once twice fifty times a day 5
 just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe and stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major disaster
 the abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its evil red depths and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained cold 6
 cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung up under doors around loosened window frames from the sleeping porches the attic from the widened cracks between shingles on the roof
 presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen which had never been removed when the new gas range was installed and the fireplaces and an electric heater in grandma's room
 it was so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them like people stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only important thing was to cling together and survive
 the pipes burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while they swabbed the bathrooms
 they lived mainly in the kitchen; they moved maggie's bed and the baby's basket there and the rest of them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper polar regions and plunged into icy beds
 grandma said it was just like the early mining camp days and it was the way people ought to live only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she used to
 you said a mouthful eugenia said grimly
 eugenia hated being cold worse than anything and she was beginning to find the joys of poverty wearing thin
 she said to maggie that it was one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it and it was beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever
 plenty of people are poor all their lives
 plenty of people haven't our brains and talent
 i know you when you start talking about brains and talent maggie said
 you're working up to something and if you don't watch out you'll ruin your whole life one of these days just to prove that the abernathy family is superior to everything even a depression 5
 the only thing that worries me is how i'm going to prove it eugenia said
 they begged grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen for her but grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange beds and be seen with her teeth out and that she hoped to die in privacy like a christian and if the lord willed it to be of pneumonia than it would have to be that way
 she didn't want to be the only one with a stove in her room especially as her life span was nearly run out anyway and she insisted that hope have the heater
 hope wouldn't hear of it and she took the heater back to grandma's room and grandma took it back to hope's room and the two of them dragged it back and forth until grandma tipped it over and almost set her bedspread on fire
 she said that proved she wasn't to be trusted with a fire in her room and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody knowing it 6
 eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth and still wanted her own way but hope said if grandma wouldn't have the heater nobody would have it so grandma had to give in
 thrifty of her to use it up
 unusual in a case like this but-   you can joke! didn't you read it? 7
  she's married that tenant!   i read it yes
 this ought to simplify tolley's life
 laban had more to say
 tolley had gone to live in california
 he'd mentioned it himself at church and everybody seemed to have the idea that tolley had left because jenny had jilted him for roy robards
 it was plain as the nose on your face that they're laughing about it mamma
 zion stayed to get my pin but it'll be a cold day in june when i go back
 we will both go back laban! kizzie turned to go inside 10
 let me stay and take the pictures you wanted mamma 9
 the sun's right-   pictures? 18
  she swung around
 what pictures? 19
    in brace's room! you told me to bring my camera 8
 i'm not going back-   indeed you are! why should i want pictures of an empty room now? 4
  tolley had no idea of marrying that sneaky little jenny! this- trip of his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants and i am going to see that everybody at mt pleasant understands that simple fact
 wait for me laban i'll be dressed in half a second! frank followed her into the bedroom hooked her dress up the back 6
 hurry frank! they're not going to laugh at the fairbrothers and labans very long! tolley's going is my fault
 you know it and i'll tell everybody exactly how it happened 12
 she was so beautiful so valiant so pitiable 10
 make your confession to god kizzie dear not to the congregation
 i'll decide that when i get there
 i was so cruel to tolley so unfair
 but i'll be fair now! he is coming back isn't he frank? 7
  yes oh yes
 what else was there to say? 10
  returning to the log-house he found some favorite lines from jonathan swift on his lips: under the window in stormy weather   i marry this man and woman together
 let none but him who rules the thunder put this man and woman asunder
 absolution for his lie? 11
  he questioned god's taking time to telegraph the message but he felt better about kizzie and he took the sealed envelope from its pigeonhole wondering why he had preserved it
 if he died before she did she would never be unable to resist opening it
 in any case he would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons making them parties to a deception peculiarly his own 6
 it was simply his necessity to confess which had made him write and keep this thing
 you've told god frank he said
 why lacerate the- congregation? 15
  reaching for an old clay pot relic of pioneer days he tore the envelope in pieces dropping them into it touching the little pyre to flame watching it curl the red sealing wax melting and bubbling in the feathery ash
 surely now his beloved son could rest in peace
 'and let me go for the night gathers me and in the night shall no man gather fruit'
 a beautiful and haunting line a subtle genius swinburne difficult not to envy a gifted man and perhaps he did h 7
 but there were great satisfactions even for a small man 13
 beyond his window were the greening trees new spring eternal hope eternal life
 there lay grand fair's quinzaine his own young parents' graves but new life and promise for his sons grandsons
 he poured his thimble of wine for the toast he'd made so often 9
 but this last time he drank not to brace but to tolley! mr robards- jenny was the only person she knew of in the mt pleasant neighborhood who called him that- was kind but too easygoing 5
 it didn't bother him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say howdy miss jenny adding a careless roy but it did her 6
 he could put a stop to it she told him again and again 8
 simply call mr whipsnade oscar and dr dunne pg and c'un major frank
 mr robards laughed said he'd feel a damn fool plain-out couldn't do that even to please her
 and if i ever hear you say 'mist laban' again i'll scream 12
 and don't tell me you didn't at church sunday 8
 i heard you!   he really hadn't meant to he assured her but it was plain to her that the importance of these small things was lost on mr robards
 how strange it was that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its beautiful furnishings and fail her in- spiritual ways
 another weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking which he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse of tolley's
 but mr robards' now oh my yes indeed yes! he called her the mare much as mrs whipsnade spoke of the queen god bless her
 h he with fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there in the barn was reverent only of the mare the racin' mare the revolting gunny
 for the first few months of their marriage she had tried to be nice about gunny going out with him to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall
 and what had happened? 21
  gunny invariably tried to bite her
 nerves mr robards said just a nip anyway
 stand back miss jen she's oneasy of your scarf
 never quit that you sor'l devil! never concern for his wife's nerves or the danger that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in january
 she musn't annoy gunny whose foal was due then too!   listening for hours to his laments that the war and mist fair's poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing triumph and to his predictions of greatness for the procession of foals to come jenny could look forward to years of conflict with an animal who disliked her intensely and showed it
 gunny symbolized so much that was unpleasant- tolley the indifference with which the fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband his lack of understanding and sympathy in her present condition her disgusting swollen stomach
 human birth was no novelty to mr robards
 tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick he suggested 7
 jenny's aversion to having dr dunne a former admirer seemed silly to him but he would humor her get anybody she wanted the best never being too good for her
 the chances were against his being here to humor her when her time came she was sur e
 he would be in the barn or riding for the veterinarian! night after night he stayed with gunny in the dead of winter rubbing her with quarts of expensive liniment fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte russe tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come to the house
 yet when the dear baby came he had tillie over here in a jiffy and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when it was all over as any husband could have been
 jenny wished now that she had had dr dunne feeling that somehow he wouldn't have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets 5
 there was something not nice about triplets though their father seemed pleased showing no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted saying you don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day miss jen hon
 rhyme 'em up cute- arcilla flotilla h edmonia for her mother she said firmly jennifer for herself and-   kezziah for miss kizzie he suggested
 she was mighty good to you past times an' this'll fetch her 7
 now she must be thinking of a boy-name something special 6
 just wait till she saw the mare's foal
 handsomest colt in all kentucky
 strong too up on his legs when he was an hour old 9
 what about royal robards? 13
  why don't you name him jesus christ! she burst into tears 7
 he'd had no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been 6
 of course she wasn't herself right now but as her strength came back her spirits didn't seem to rise with it
 he had a good idea why not
 those elegant at home cards she sent out now she could wear her pretty clothes again and had the house all trimmed up hadn't brought many callers in two whole months
 doc dunne and miss sis had come
 so had miss shawnee rakestraw full of criticisms about the changes here giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his heavenly rest last year saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town in inclement weather was looking forward to quinzaine spa this summer
 miss kizzie had been right snippy ever since they were married though you'd have thought a namesake would have brought her round 5
 oh she'd come to see them once left silver teething rings for all of the trips
 but when miss jen went over right away to return the call miss kiz couldn't have been very cordial for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there
 more and more these days she'd been driving that pretty little mare that looked like her over to tillie's and nick's- his own old square frame box on posts chickens and cats and pups under the house everybody friendly inside making a to-do over the babies dressed like dollies
 though he was glad she got on well with his young folks she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land too
 it made him pretty hot under the collar after the idea miss sis had given him to be told by miss kiz that her holy spa was all reserved for this summer and next if you please and that much as she regretted it they would be unable to entertain mrs robards and the children
 she hoped they were well
 he didn't tell miss jen but she must have got word from the cook or nurse who of course knew those quinzaine nigs and she really took a fit
 if he ever did such a thing again she'd die of shame 9
 have a party an' leave 'em out hon he suggested 11
 a swell party send an invite to ever'body but them- those folks you met at the galt house the ones i've got to know in this new jockey club affair the whole dang neighborhood
 we'll have oystchers- couple bar'l oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time
 i'll see word gets round
 don't you dare!   miss jen was funny that way funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and perk up 3
 he was downright worried about her but there was one more thing he could try h
 zion was surprised when roy's buggy stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking home from the country school where she was teaching now that eph showers had had a call to preach in some mountain town
 roy smiled- he did have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely told her to hop in and he'd give her a lift to quinzaine 5
 her hesitation was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it as she settled herself asked quickly how miss jenny and the babies were getting on
 see for yourself miss zion
 it won't take a minute
 he swung in through his own wide gateway
 them's the purtiest babes you ever did see but miss jen gets mighty lonesome
 she'll relish the sight of a friendly face
 miss kiz won't care your comin' will she? 10
    why of course not zion said uncomfortably
 he must have forgiven me henrietta murmured to the room 11
 the absolution of doaty's last will and testament was proof enough of that; doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman 5
 she found herself wishing an old wish that she had told doaty she was running away that she had left something more behind her than the loving sorry note and her best garnet pin 7
 perhaps doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel 8
 henrietta thought it's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us
 there had been more to know about hetty inevitably and most of it unfavorable
 adelia was the good one or if not always good less frequently tempted
 their childhood would have been quite circumspect without hetty's flair for drama especially through the long summers 6
 in winter in the city there had been the maneret school which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge; there had been lessons in french from a small polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils; there had been the dancing class- miss craddock thin and tireless with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three one-two-three
 there had been supper parties and teas fetes and little balls mama small and pretty and gay and papa enormously jocular enormously possessive the sun around which the blackwell planets revolved 6
 mama had died before the corruption of the family circle the interruption of charles
 it was safe to assume that papa sighing heavily had said many times to his remaining daughter thank god your poor mother was spared this and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for henrietta to leave with her hand in charles' hand just because her poor mother was gone already and would never know
 mama was vulnerable; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her
 but i would have gone anyway thought henrietta
 she had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice
 only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in doaty's bed- she found herself examining how others might regard her
 perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice
 she turned on her side finding the idea oppressive 9
 if adelia had felt about someone as henrietta felt about charles would she have run away with him? 8
  impossible to imagine adelia feeling so about anyone 6
 no temptation no virtue? 15
    a curious thought to end a curious night
 the birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music and light was beginning to creep across the room touching sill and door table and chair and all of doaty's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf 6
 before anything else she would go to doaty's grave with flowers from doaty's forgotten garden
 everything must wait upon this mission this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards
 she closed her eyes remembering the small french cemetery enclosed by stone walls
 it had always seemed to rain there and even the grass was gray 11
 after the sad impatient moment waiting for comfort which could not come she slipped out of bed and went to the open window 6
 the garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness
 leaning out she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle one not quite come to bloom one just beyond it
 on a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds like a summer valentine a bird balanced and sang nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music a little engine of song
 it was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things but doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age 5
 feeling suddenly neat and subdued she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs
 rosa unbelievably was not yet up and about reassurance that rosa was human
 feeling protective toward this sleeping being henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot
 outside the garden the tame wilderness yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies sweet william scented stock and lady's bedstraw which she tied with long grasses and took back to show rosa who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing folly
 the poodle came gleefully to henrietta and begged for the flowers supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws
 henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for doaty
 rummaging in the dew said rosa coldly
 go change your shoes before you turn around
 she sounded so exactly like doaty that henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home 7
 folly danced eager for whatever lay beyond the door 6
 to a blackwell there was only one church
 the cemetery slumbered just behind it and the way lay through the village and close to the sea
 for the first time in thirty years henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity
 she smiled and bowed recalling the princess- in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child
 now some of the acknowledgments were cautious but all were interested
 an old man sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him gave her a more than reflective look as she passed the sap still plainly rising in his branches
 on an impulse she turned back and said good morning 10
 he cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time 5
 he then offered his own estimate of the weather which was unenthusiastic
 summer's been slow to come he said
 it's my dryin' out time
 he scowled at her flowers
 i'm taking them to the cemetery said henrietta out of a vague feeling of hospitality
 they'll be takin' me next he said pleasantly but not so soon's they plan
 see half of 'em in their graves before i choose my own coffin 8
 it's dryin' myself out that does it
 he regarded her with rising hope
 you'd like to hear how i go about it
 it's nice of you henrietta said doubtfully
 he straightened himself soldierly against the wall and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots 6
 his stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text 7
 every month f'r three days he said happily i take no water into my system no water whatsoever
 henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense
 rests the tissues he said and pacifies the system 6
 my dad did it and he lived to a great age
 he looked up at her sharply
 don't remember do you? 4
  she did suddenly through the link of memory with his father old titus who must have been in his nineties when henrietta ran away
 next to the blackwells titus had owned the island most and she and adelia had often stood in front of him silenced by his terrible years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner more aged than possible
 he had never spoken once to the awed sisters but his son had been friendly a big fellow of fifty or more a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea
 it must be that son who sat before her now shriveled to half his size and half his senses
 she said gently of course i remember you
 not so well's i remember you he said
 y're the young blackwell woman
 ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man 7
 i know all about you
 you do seem to said henrietta impressed
 can't blame a man for leavin' his wife he said quite cheerfully
 left mine many a time only she never knew it
 man in a boat there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit
 any harm in that? 13
  probably said henrietta dryly
 he gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly 10
 you'd be the one to say he observed and she found herself liking his approval none too well but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were different since all actions had their own laws
 only this old man's connivance was even less to her taste than selma cotter's open censure
 well she had not come back to great island to be understood praised or condemned
 she had come to make her peace with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow 10
 she started to move away just as a woman came out of the cottage a big-boned drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress
 she smiled vaguely at henrietta and spoke to the old man 10
 you've not had your breakfast yet gran'da d
 y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast he said
 milk and sops! he beat the air with his stick and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones
 he's owly today his grand-daughter said wearily and bent to pick it up
 he's got this idea about drying out h   it ain't an idea! if it ain't an idea she said how comes it you can drink beer but not water? 4
    he looked piously to heaven and said beer don't affect the tissues none and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence 6
 come on do
 the children are eating and miss blackwell's on her way somewheres
 who ain't? 18
  not me
 i've got a day's work to do
 you'll be visiting miss doaty ma'am? 5
    henrietta nodded
 how much they knew about her!   the woman answered the nod with her own
 god rest her soul she was a sweet one
 come on now
 she put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old
 he mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength 7
 there was a gabble of voices from indoors young hungry sounds like cats after fish and a burst of swearing from the old man 7
 henrietta looked down at her bouquet still lively with its color and scent and set her feet on their journey's way again leaving the village street and crossing the first field folly dancing ahead of her
 at the edge of the field the wild rolling land took over dotted with fat round bushes like sheep
 they were covered with tiny white blossoms their scant roots clawing at the stony ground and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry 6
 the air was full of sounds too but placid ones a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky 8
 she felt mindless walking and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery and she caught herself wondering what she would say to doaty
 both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named dorothy tredding seemed suddenly impossible
 she sat down on the nearest fallen with age and gray with sea-damp her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss
 the day's sun was gathering its strength in gold and she wished she had brought her parasol if only to shade doaty's flowers 6
 a small rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb the only angel in the cemetery
 she remembered suddenly a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and adelia having dared each other had stolen out of their great safe house and come here hand in hand hoping and fearing ghosts
 the momoyama family had come from miyagi prefecture in the northeast of the main japanese island of honshu where there are still traces of the mysterious ainu strain
 the ainus were a primitive people already living on the island before the principal ancestors of the japanese came from southern asia
 apparently they were of caucasian blood 13
 they had white skins and blue eyes; all their men were bearded and many of their women were beautiful
 a pitiful few of them are left now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing their ancient tribal chants which have the same haunting sadness as the laments of the american indians 6
 most of them have been assimilated but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefectures is much more hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the tawny honey- in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the south
 tommy momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions 15
 she was taller than most japanese girls and had the exquisitely willowy form of the japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall 6
 her nose was higher of bridge her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth that were white and regular and strong 6
 her mouth soft and full was something for any man to dream about
 she had black eyes long and intriguingly tilted and the way she walked was melody
 she had been in japan just one week
 it was an alien land and she hated it intensely; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests for duty at san diego bremerton the great lakes pensacola- any place the navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission if the request were not granted
 anywhere would be better than the land of her ancestors 6
 there was nothing wrong with her job
 tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic war d
 there were no depressingly serious cases: the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor- sometimes the navy sent people back to the states to preserve a marriage- but mental health as a rule was very high 8
 at present the doctor's main concern was in seeing to it that japanese salvage firms were not permitted to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore because the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours
 tommy was interested in psychiatry because there was much an understanding nurse could do to help the patients
 but she suffered in her off-duty hours
 such as now when she sat at a table in the coffee shop at the officers' club having coffee and a hamburger to sustain her until dinnertime
 she had changed into a cocktail dress and the whole evening should have been before her but already she was beginning to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck
 this was one of the navy's crossroads- you find them all around the world
 ships from the west coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the seventh fleet and yokosuka was the seventh fleet's principal port for maintenance upkeep and shore liberty
 sooner or later all the gray navy ships came in here; if tommy sat long enough she would be sure to see all the young officers she had met in san diego and long beach
 and she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back there
 she felt rather than saw the approach of the good-looking young man
 he came through from the fleet bar which was stag with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried
 when he saw tommy sitting alone the tinkling sound stopped 14
 he was perhaps a trifle tipsy having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted and consequently out of practice; he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously tailored in hong kong and he was of an age that marked him as a lieutenant
 probably off one of the carriers- an aviator
 there was a fifty-fifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an even more slender chance that his approach would be different
 japan did something to a man- and it wasn't just japan either because the same thing applied anywhere overseas
 it was as if foreign duty implied and excused license; it intimated that the folks at home would never know about it and therefore why not? 6
    then the young man in the brown sports jacket spoke and it was no different
 harro girl-san! he said turning on what was meant to be charm
 you catchee boy-furiendo? 24
  maybe you likee date with me? 11
  i beg your pardon! tommy said out of her cold rage 7
 i don't believe i know you and i can't understand your quaint brand of english- it was meant to be english wasn't it? 4
    the nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels open-mouthed and blushing
 at least he had the decency to blush she thought 11
 oh- i'm sorry! you see i thought- i mean i really had no idea-   oh yes- you had ideas! tommy interrupted furiously
 all wrong ones! then she jerked her thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and dropped into navy slang
 take off fly-boy!   uh- sorry! he muttered and took off obviously feeling like a fool
 the trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for tommy
 she felt like a fool too
 it hadn't been this way in college or in nurses' training; it wasn't this way in the hospital at san diego
 everybody had accepted her for what she was- a very charming girl
 nobody had addressed her in broken english at any of those places nobody had suggested that she wasn't american
 there are spanish girls who look like tommy momoyama brunettes with a moorish hint of the orient in their faces; there are beauties from the balkan states who are similarly endowed and- back in the blessed united states- they were regarded simply as pretty women 6
 now having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not asked for tommy was being humiliated at every turn 6
 four little japanese waitresses were murdering the english language at the counter- yuki kobayashi happened to be one of them 8
 everybody but tommy seemed to think it was charming when they called bifutek-san! for a steak sandwich or kohi futotsu! for one cup of coffee
 two other japanese girls were sitting at the tables both quite pretty and well groomed
 one was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander; the other was with her american husband and their exceptionally appealing children
 seeing these did nothing for tommy's mood
 she told herself rebelliously and with pride i am an american!   and so she was and would remain
 but she was learning that so long as she was in this country and wore civilian dress in the club there would always be transient young men who would approach her with broken english
 there had been occasions when some of the more experienced had even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good japanese 9
 tommy wouldn't know; after coming to america her parents had spoken only english
 one thing was becoming increasingly sure
 she had been sent to the wrong place for duty 16
 there was more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hours in the ward
 one had to have friends and a congenial life in after-duty hours h
 now there was raucous male singing from the fleet bar 7
 it was terribly off key and poorly done and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship was a very natural and important thing but all at once she felt lonesome and put-upon
 she finished her hamburger and drank her coffee and paid her check; she got out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeated
 eating while angry had given her a slight indigestion 8
 back in her living quarters at the hospital she took bicarbonate of soda and sulked
 then after a while she went to her mirror 10
 she certainly looked japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young men
 and still they did not have to be so crude in their approach h 13
 there was a letter to write to her mother and she tried to make its tone cheerful
 she promised that she would soon take a few day's leave and visit the uncle she had never seen on the island of oyajima- which was not very far from yokusuka
 and tomorrow she would take time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown
 tommy of course had never heard of a kotowaza or japanese proverb which says tanin yori miuchi and is literally translated as relatives are better than strangers
 actually this is only another way of saying that blood is thicker than water
 doc doolittle's scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young and immature and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report
 but the beer hall riot in subic had been unusual too and walt perry was convinced that doc had started it through some expert tactics in rabble rousing
 just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer didn't know
 in his opinion doc had not grown up
 the lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief 10
 there had never been a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up
 he had come into the navy too young with the image of the fun-loving gu ns appleby before him
 the war found him much too early and its perils- and especially its awful boredom- were best forgotten in horseplay and elaborate practical jokes and even now doc had never found any stabilizing sobering influence
 he remained young at heart with an overdeveloped sense of humor 10
 he wisecracked about the captain's indoctrination of new men took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches with ethyl chloride and gave no thought for tomorrow
 he was doing thirty years and the navy would take care of him 13
 the job security enjoyed by doc doolittle and nearly all members of the armed forces is a wonderful thing
 actually all a man in uniform has to do is to get by 10
 he may not rise to the heights but he can get by and eventually be retired
 doc had been under restriction to the ship since the bustard left subic
 this deprived him of liberty in hong kong but he told boats mccafferty that hong kong was a book he had read before and the navy would always bring him there again some day
 at yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of the base because walt perry being thoughtful knew that doc might have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the supply base
 this gave doc the whole range of the naval establishment a nd suited him quite well
 there were two things he wanted to do: inspect one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the naval base and visit an old shipmate
 a telephone line had been hooked up to connect the ship with the base exchange
 after supper doc called whitey gresham who was now a lieutenant and had a family
 well doc you old sonofabitch! whitey exclaimed with true affection
 come over and have a drink
 we live down by the base commissary
 i'll be there but i'll walk doc said
 i've got to run an errand on the way
 see you in about an hour
 he threw a smart salute at the gangway went up the dock and turned down the wide street in front of the petty officers' club 5
 how he wondered does one enjoy one's spare time? 9
  he considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk
 then there was exercise boating and hiking which was not only good for you but also made you more virile: the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted
 perhaps golf with a fashionable companion- but he'd lost his clubs hadn't played in years
 there was swimming over at the riverside hotel but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog 10
 perhaps a packing trip into the sierras let his beard grow- but that was too stark
 i could he thought take a long walk- but where? 11
    the telephone rang
 you missed it buzz's voice said you should have gone over to the pagan room with us
 strippers but scrumptious and toodle williams and her all-lesbian band
 i went over to the willows and dropped two notes 12
 tough buzz said listen we're having a stag dinner over at the pagan room on friday
 imagine a stag dinner with toodle williams
 owen wanted to be pleasant because buzz worked the territory next to his but he hadn't come to reno for stag dinners 5
 thanks owen said but friday is a long way off and anything can happen
 buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest 6
 when owen was finally rid of him there was a timid rap at the door
 yes? 15
    i'm mrs gertrude parker a soft voice explained and i'd like to talk to you for a few minutes please
 ahah he thought a lush divorcee at last
 probably saw me in the lobby
 he was disappointed to find a nervous scrawny woman with a big hat standi ng at the door
 she frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons 9
 how do you do? 17
  she said semi-professionally
 our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in alaska
 we call them lay-sisters and they go among the eskimos making friends and bringing the light
 they're up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them
 oh? 19
  you see she said looking past him into the room where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light you and i can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo 5
 why is that? 21
    she apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction 9
 smug owen thought smug and sappy
 there was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye 12
 it gave her a lewd winking effect
 have you ever tried to reason with an eskimo? 11
  she asked winking wildly
 they are a very difficult group of people
 i don't know much about them owen admitted but i suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do
 she smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion
 you know that's very interesting
 people don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that
 the more canvassing i do the more i note how far most people are from their personal god
 forebearing owen kept his peace
 what would happen next? 19
  that she was out for a touch was certain but when did she get to the pitch? 5
  several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated trying to close the door a little and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice
 how did you get by the desk? 10
  he asked curiously
 i'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around the corridors knocking on strangers' doors and talking down eskimos 3
 oh i just come once a week
 every day i visit a different hotel
 i feel it's my duty
 i do this work all on my own because i understand the difficulties and i want to help these lay-sisters
 do you know these women go all through alaska and they don't have the proper facilities? 6
  they travel in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day
 do you have any idea how far i travel every day? 8
  i have the whole pacific northwest
 owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldn't help himself
 mrs gertrude parker drew back
 that's hardly a christian approach she remonstrated 5
 you're in the secular world
 i didn't say it was christian
 i don't think you'll find many active christian salesmen 4
 not that religion isn't big business; those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses but they don't get top personnel
 our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics 7
 god i take it plays no part in this she said waspishly 10
 god doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics he said heatedly before he caught himself
 it sounded silly; why go on? 16
  more people were passing; he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation
 and whiskey she said smiling and blinking at the highball glasses 9
 don't forget whiskey; it's such a big seller 3
 you know he said getting a grip on himself i think you're going to have to excuse me
 i can imagine she said
 probably down at the bar
 but what do you want to do about the lay-sisters? 18
  they must be freezing up there now
 can't you help them? 9
  leave a card or something
 i have no card she said bitterly
 you haven't been listening to what i've been telling you 11
 i only hope my talking to you has helped you a little anyway because you need spiritual bucking-up
 she looked crestfallen as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race
 she stood indecisively for a moment then walked down the hall; he heard her knocking on another door
 it took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself; then he realized he was hungry
 he showered shaved dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast
 on the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail 14
 there was a check from his company and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued
 his lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony and there was a letter from the collector of internal revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's exemptions 8
 he ate breakfast in a sullen mood but afterwards when he walked out onto virginia street he felt braced
 he looked off to the crest of the sierras still white-topped; the glisten of the truckee river made a wide spangle
 he felt suddenly elated adventurous
 with any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot 9
 although it was only three o'clock he stopped in at the golden calf
 the tables were all spinning the dice rattling the bar crowded 9
 just to test himself he played roulette for quarters on his old combination five and seventeen and within an hour he had won surprisingly twenty dollars
 the way was opening up; when the management brought around champagne the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach 8
 the golden calf was dimly lit with shaded neon 8
 there were more women than men in the place but he couldn't find a flowerpot
 they all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming who automatically turned the cards hardly caring what showed up 5
 the mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons who appeared much more animated than the gamblers
 the women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance while the men were stern but hopeful
 all of course except the donner party who were bent on starving to death
 i wonder if they did eat each other at the end owen mused 13
 he sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes
 she sighed a dirty word and left
 owen was surprised to see mrs gertrude parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance 6
 she sat down and played two slots at once looking grim as if bested by mechanical devices and owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support
 a dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place 11
 he was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables
 what you need is a steady martingale the cowboy announced after watching owen play
 you can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen 6
 what are you playing? 27
  owen asked
 i'm just logging the cowboy explained
 i keep all these plays in this little black book and i watch over a twelve-hour period to find out what numbers are repeating 5
 but roulette's not my game
 i'm always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack 7
 incidentally i'm pretty famous in these parts: i'm called the wrangler
 don't you have to spend any time on your ranch? 4
    well of course i do
 i'm with the bar-h pushing a horse called sparky 4
 he's my own horse and what i collect from him i use on blackjack 5
 this sparky can rack and single-foot and he's the fastest thing in washoe county
 i figure if i can get any kind of publicity campaign going i'll land him on tv- you know one of those favorite horses for some western hero
 i once trained a horse for hoot gibson but nothing like sparky 7
 he's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully
 five came up while owen was listening to the wrangler and he neglected to play a loss of ten dollars
 this proved conclusively that the wrangler was a jinx so he walked on down to hurrays an even more glorified gambling den than the golden calf
 when he looked in the back mrs gertrude parker was marking keno cards
 his adventurous spirit had waned; he studied the pistol exhibition that hurrays featured as an added attraction
 he ogled a long redhead with green eyes but she was a shill with her money in front of her
 he had no great prejudice against shills; it just seemed such a dry run
 there was no cash around; everyone was flipping silver dollars 12
 the management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points 6
 he read a special announcement whereby hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three am starring adele brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls
 he wondered if he might bag a tourist but they looked frightened of him
 he passed two brides both wearing orchids and they made him feel a little sad
 owen found buzz watching chuck-a-luck
 buzz had on a hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark glasses
 he was shorter and fatter than owen who felt good standing next to him
 we're all going over to lake tahoe and try our luck at cal-neva buzz explained still instigating
 we ran into a guy at the pagan room who guarantees we can beat the wheel
 he started out as a stickman then became a pit boss until the club found him crossroading
 he was knocking down checks at faro
 i'm allergic to tahoe owen explained
 well okay buzz said
 we'll see you around later
 owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot but he couldn't pyramid with any consecutive success
 how's your luck honey? 9
  a short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him 8
 she looked well-fed and prosperous but he didn't get the impression he was being propositioned the way he'd been hoping 5
 i haven't had any luck since i was a baby
 stake me she said and let me at those dice
 i'll make them dance the tango
 we'll get it in a hurry and get it out
 let's have a drink and discuss a merger
 if you go broke she said smiling up at him i'll leave you 9
 sounds like real love owen said
 it sort of brings a lump to my throat
 my name's gisele the blonde said after she ordered a scotch 8
 my mother wanted to call me sylphide but it sounded too affected 6
 is there any word you would like to offer in your own defense? 12
    spencer shook his head
 alexander said answer me properly spencer
 spencer was quiet for a moment longer then he said there is nothing i want to say captain
 naval procedure he thought had its moments of grim humor 8
 philip spencer had cold- bloodedly planned the murder of his captain yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse of proper address
 during the morning hours it became clear that the arrest of spencer was having no sobering effect upon the men of the somers 11
 those named in the greek paper were manufacturing reasons to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty so as to be near spencer watching an opportunity to communicate with him
 hostile glances were flashed at both alexander and gansevoort 8
 the two met in the captain's cabin
 what is the next step captain? 21
  more arrests i fear
 in your opinion who is this e andrews on the 'certain' list? 10
    cromwell of course
 he is the oldest and most experienced of the lot 16
 he saw the dangers not the glories of being identified as a mutineer
 somehow he talked spencer into letting him use another name 8
 there was a tap at the door and oliver entered with the word that heiser wished to see the captain
 heiser breathless and wild-eyed brought the chilling news that the handspikes heavers and holystones had been mysteriously removed from their customary places
 and also sir two articles which were considered souvenirs now must be regarded in another light entirely
 an african knife and battle-ax are at this moment being sharpened by mckinley and green
 mckinley was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife into spencer's possession and that- where did you gather all this information heiser? 5
  who reported to you the disappearance of handspikes and heavers and who- he was interrupted by a crash from the deck and sprang toward the ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind him
 a glance revealed that the main topgallant mast had been carried away
 the aimless milling about of what had been a well-trained well-organized crew struck alexander with horror
 he bellowed orders and watched the alert response of some of his men and watched too the way a dozen or more turned their heads questioningly toward the shackled figure as though for further instruction
 adrien deslonde hastened to alexander's side 10
 small violently jerked the weather-royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast
 i saw him myself and it was done after consultation with cromwell
 and it was clear that adrien was not mistaken for both small and cromwell took no step toward aiding in the sending up of the new topgallant mast till philip spencer had given the signal to obey 5
 then with disappointment evident upon their faces they moved to the work
 alexander guessed that they had planned confusion and turmoil thinking it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed 6
 their strategy was sound enough and he reasoned had been defeated only by philip spencer's unwillingness to sanction an idea he had not originated
 when the mast was raised alexander gave the order for small and cromwell to be placed under arrest and now three figures in irons sprawled upon the open deck and terror stalked the somers 5
 spencer's potential followers were openly sullen and morose missing muster without excuse expressing in ominous tones their displeasure at the prisoners being kept in irons communicating with the three by glance and signal
 one of the missing handspikes came out of its hiding place after midshipman tillotson had been insolently disobeyed by seaman wilson 9
 tillotson had reported the man to gansevoort and an hour later with back turned had been attacked by wilson brandishing the weapon 6
 wilson shackled and snarling was thrown with the other prisoners and was soon joined by green mckee and mckinley
 not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by the sight of seven men involved in the crime of mutiny 8
 in the tiny cabin alexander met with gansevoort heiser and wales to speak and to listen
 three days had passed since spencer's arrest and each day had brought new dangers new fears
 gansevoort said it requires an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely
 to have the greek paper is not the great help that at first flush it seemed
 from actions aboard it is easy to guess that spencer's boast of twenty staunch followers was a modest estimate
 well heiser ventured why don't we hold an investigation with questioning and-   that would be worse than useless alexander broke in 7
 there is not space to hold or force to guard any increased number of prisoners
 besides suppose we hold a court of inquiry then what? 9
  then we have informed a large number of our crew that when they reach the united states they will be punished but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs in good order 5
 mr heiser does this sound like a truly workable plan to you? 8
  do you not think these men might choose the black flag here and now? 7
    wales said of course they would
 they are about to do so at any moment as it is 13
 all that is needed is for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead
 as soon as that one man is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal from spencer we are going to be rushed
 we are going to be rushed and murdered
 that is extravagant language mr wales
 we are not going to be rushed and murdered alexander said 21
 we are going to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound
 of course i agree with the captain gansevoort said thoughtfully but the conspiracy is ferocious and desperate 10
 the instinct of discipline has been lost
 anything is possible when anarchy has the upper hand 8
 he paused then added everything on a ship is a weapon 7
 implements of wood and iron are available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stands
 and we are positive of so few and suspicious of so many 7
 we ourselves must stand sentinel
 under arms day and night watch and watch about
 those of us present the perry brothers deslonde and the other midshipmen now have the responsibility of the somers 10
 a great deal of labor we have as well for we are too uncertain of where trust may be placed
 and when he was alone again in the cabin alexander lowered his head into his arms and wept for he knew full well what must be done what in the end would be done
 with all his heart he had loved the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navy's implacable laws
 and when he did when he gave to his ship that protection necessary to preserve her honor he knew he would lose forever the navy to which he had dedicated his soul
 where had he failed? 11
  how had he failed? 13
  he who had tried so hard who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer
 it came to him as he wept there aboard the somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness as to seek to storm the gates of heaven
 it was given or it was not given
 one did one's best and if fortune smiled there was a reward 8
 one did one's best and if fortune frowned an eighteen-year-old boy with murder in his heart sailed aboard one's ship
 and alexander sobbed like a girl for the dreams he had had and he felt no shame
 god knew his tears were his to shed if he so desired for it had not been with an egotist's rage for fame that he had held precious his naval career
 another field had given him fame enough to satisfy any egotist 8
 it was for love that he had served the navy
 to have someday that love returned was what he had lived for 11
 now the hope was gone
 yes he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price
 dear god at what a price
 and after a while he dried his tears and walked the deck as a captain should with assurance and dignity
 stern-faced he inspected the prisoners satisfying himself that they were clean well fed and comfortable within reason
 the prisoners averted their eyes but not before he had glimpsed hatred and anger
 only cromwell the giant boatswain was mild-mannered and respectful
 he said captain may i speak please? 17
  captain i am innocent of any plot against you or the ship 6
 are you cromwell? 18
    yes sir
 before god i swear i am innocent
 i know nothing of any plot if there is such a thing 10
 you are the only man aboard who can be in doubt 12
 i cannot speak for others sir but i am innocent
 he leaned closer to alexander squinting up at him from the deck 10
 surely captain you did not find my name on any suspicious paper or anything
 no cromwell i did not find your name
 you were careful about that
 now spencer seeming with effort to shake himself from lethargy spoke
 he said cromwell is telling you the truth 13
 alexander shifted his gaze to spencer
 the calmness and detachment of his tone suggested unawareness of how implicit was his own guilt in the words he had used to defend cromwell
 alexander knew spencer too well to think him nai^ve or thick-skulled
 and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognized a kinship with spencer
 here was another human who understood the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable
 there was good fortune and there was bad and philip spencer in handcuffs and ankle irons knew it to be a truth
 he expected nothing for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune
 the red-haired captain towering above the prisoner as a symbol of decency and authori ty was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon philip spencer
 this tragic lad had forged his own shackles 10
 but he could not have done so could not have found the way had fortune favored him
 and because fortune had favored neither the prisoner nor the red-haired captain they would be each other's undoing
 spencer if there is guilt if you do not deny your own how is it possible for cromwell to be innocent? 5
  he was your constant companion
 the hazel eyes met alexander's
 i tell you he is innocent
 and do you think there is a reason why i should accept your word? 8
    yes
 i have nothing to gain by defending cromwell 12
 nothing to lose either spencer
 that's true spencer agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation
 his eyes went back to contemplation of the sea 10
 i am innocent captain cromwell said again
 before god captain i am innocent
 and though it was logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still it was difficult to understand why spencer spoke only for cromwell
 the boatswain was as guilty as any
 no action of his could be interpreted in his favor and four midshipmen prior to their knowing the significance of the greek paper had seen it in cromwell's hands while spencer whispered explanations 5
 i thought midshipman rogers had told alexander that spencer was teaching him geometry
 it was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles to the wardroom where a class of apprentices awaited him
 this was a training ship and the training would continue but there was an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognized
 some of these apprentices were in physical strength already men and doubtless a percentage of them were spencer's followers 5
 rachel steered me along toward a school for young boys beginning to study the torah
 bits of trash lay in the roadway
 the air smelled warmish and foul
 a young man appeared out of a side alley and walked toward us with quick strides
 he wore a long double-breasted coat of a heavy material dark trousers and black boots with buckles
 his black hat with its wide brim high crown and fur trim rode high
 with his head erect he approached not glancing at us and passed by with his clear eyes raised and fixed straight ahead 7
 he had a pinkish-white complexion a small straight nose a short black beard and tightly curled paot
 i was suddenly conscious of my bare arms
 the girls in the market place wore long-sleeved dresses and covered their legs with cloth stockings
 i turned and watched him stride down the center of the road 10
 his hands were swinging at his sides and he passed through the dingy market place with his back straight and pivoting on his heel he entered an old stone building
 rachel had seen me watching the young man
 when your mother was here he must have been a young boy 9
 like the ones you will see now
 i swallowed hard and looked down at my feet plodding along beside rachel
 she led me into a twisting side alley
 the dirty discolored buildings looked boarded up and their few windows stood high above our heads
 rachel said that schools and synagogues occupied most of the buildings
 we entered one where the front door stood ajar and climbed a flight of steep steps to the main floor
 an old man with a white beard and dressed in a long shabby coat baggy trousers and a black skullcap greeted us
 he nodded clasping and unclasping his hands over his paunch and flicked glances at me
 i thought he would ask us to leave because rachel and i were bare-armed but he looked down into his beard and preceded us down the corridor
 his toes pointed out toward the walls
 he stopped in front of a door placed a finger on his lips and still peering down into his beard pushed open the door to a classroom 9
 he left us
 little boys crowded together on long wooden benches and in the center of the room sat the teacher
 his black beard dripped down over the front of his coat 8
 one white hand poised a stick above his desk
 he turned his surly half-closed eyes toward us stared for a second then shouted in yiddish one two three! rapping the stick against the desk
 the little boys shrilled out a yiddish translation or interpretation of the five books of moses which they had previously chanted in hebrew
 they chanted a fixed tune in time to the report of the stick 8
 each boy opened his small mouth wide and rocked back and forth on the bench in the way his grandfather and great-grandfather had studied and prayed in the ghettos of europe
 they had large bright eyes the small upturned noses of all babies everywhere and hair cropped short except for the long ringlets of paot framing their little white faces
 they bent over yellowed prayerbooks and looked up only to watch the teacher
 since they did not glance curiously at us once i guessed that there was a penalty for distraction
 the guttural language from the ghetto stopped 11
 the teacher plunged the children into a new portion this time in hebrew rapping the stick incessantly
 one boy who rocked back and forth over his worn book had bright red hair and freckles
 his tightly curled paot hung down to his narrow shoulders 7
 in the center of his brilliant curls sat a small black skullcap 11
 his head barely rose above the table
 i stared at him for a long time
 he did not return my interest
 my eyes traveled over the bare walls and up to the one partially open window high above the little figures and back to the boys 6
 some of them ignored the texts and had apparently memorized the words long ago
 they singsonged the portion at the teacher who accompanied them in an off-key baritone and spurred them on with the stick 7
 the tapping defined the rhythm and kept the boys awake 8
 i could not keep my eyes away from the boy with the red hair 10
 his body pitched back and forth on the bench
 his front teeth were missing
 i shuddered and backed out of the room
 rachel followed looked at me and clucked with her tongue 8
 we walked down the cool hall silently
 from behind us came the rapping of the stick and the high-pitched voices of the boys who would grow to devote their lives to rigid study and prayer
 i said how long do they keep that up? 8
  all day she said
 except for shabbat when they are praying all day 12
 i rubbed my hands together
 they had turned numb and prickly in the classroom 10
 the old man in the baggy clothes waited at the foot of the steps 13
 he glanced down into his beard and muttered something in yiddish
 rachel said he asks for money
 i reached into the pocket of my skirt fingered ten pruta and dropped the coin
 then i picked it up again and handed it to the old man 13
 i didn't look at him
 does this bother you? 21
  i said
 most of our sabras think it's horrible
 when we were fighting a few of our orthodox people were lying down in the roads so we could not pass
 they said that we must not fight but wait for the messiah 9
 you had to have convictions to lie down in the road in all those clothes and appear as though you might wish to turn yourself out of your own home
 you had to be stupid or crazy or immortal
 i was american
 you had to know also that you were going to fail 13
 all of it might have been heroic but they had done it in the wrong place
 rachel faced me
 her bright eyes were twinkling
 she said sometimes i think they are keeping religion for us while we play around
 your mother hated this way of life
 she wished to change much for the children here 10
 i said quietly respectfully what did she do here? 9
  in this section? 31
  rachel clicked her tongue behind her teeth 7
 but when she saw the children you have just visited she wanted to take them away and put them out in the country in the kibbutzim 9
 she was a strange woman your mother
 when she loved it was with a passion that drove her along and carried along with her those things she loved
 nothing was too impossible for her to do when she wanted 7
 she stayed here to work for aliah
 for many immigrants for many children the first thing they knew of israel and freedom was your mother
 sometimes it was dangerous for her
 but she loved danger
 she took it with her wherever she went; she chose it 10
 and i think she sought out danger as much as she sought out helping other people
 she was most strange woman
 ready to follow her impulse
 it was an impulse when she was here in me'a she'arim- i was with her- that led her to stay in israel
 your mother wanted to bring children to israel so that they could leave their ghettos
 here they did not need to be in ghetto s
 if she could not take the children out of this section at least she could take other children out of their countries and put them on the farms
 she set out to make sure that no jewish child anyplace in th e world had to live in a place such as this
 i said quietly gaining nerve ready to ask any question at all no matter how intimate ready to be rebuffed then why did she leave israel? 5
  i'd like to know that very much
 rachel clasped her hands together and slowed her pace 6
 the soles of her sandals reported sharply on the cobblestones 9
 she pursed her lips then clamped them together so tightly that i thought she was angry with me
 but she sighed and her face relaxed
 trouble came into her life
 she had good friends here people who liked her 12
 but she had to go out and hurt herself
 there was a man here in town
 he helped her meet people so she could go out and do the work she wanted
 there was a refugee who was able to come here because of her 12
 he came with his son
 at first i thought they were relatives of your mother but it was not so
 this refugee was a middle-aged man a big handsome man with a strut to his walk as i have never before seen
 he had the black numerals on his arm so he had been branded in a concentration camp
 yet he walked like a young man
 often he was terribly despondent and talked to no one 9
 then he would walk off for a few days alone in the direction of europe
 all his family was dead except for his son
 your mother would always retrieve him when he wandered off and she would send him home to his son
 he loved the son and was always glad to be sent back to him 9
 then his son did something- rachel threw up her hands- i don't know what but something to an official here- it was during the mandate- and the son was imprisoned
 a few hours after the son was arrested your mother was informed 7
 she ran from a little group of us
 we were sitting together talking
 she went to the father and found he had hanged himself 6
 it was silent in the stone alley
 then she continued with energy i myself did not see her until a week after she had run off to find the father
 no one saw her except the man reuveni
 i know him
 rachel gave me a direct bright-eyed look
 she said reuveni wanted your mother to give up her deep interest in this refugee
 he said she would only hurt herself
 he complained to me once that i must talk to her 7
 when i did she shrugged her shoulders and said that reuveni wanted her to marry him
 i asked her if she would and she said she would not 8
 he had known when he first helped her to meet the right people and work with them that she did not intend to marry him
 anyway i did not see her until two weeks after the refugee hanged himself
 she came to me one day
 she was pale and skinny; she was terribly alone
 and she said that after this man had been dead for a week she had gone to reuveni and accepted his proposal
 he shouted at her and told her he loved her and couldn't understand why she had upset herself
 but now he was happy she would let him straighten out her life and take care of her
 he would never let her harm herself again
 for one whole week he never let her stay alone 13
 she let him lead her around
 he took her to a doctor for she was run down nervous did not care where she was
 reuveni took her with him wherever he went
 he did not let her talk to people; he did not let her choose her own food
 she was limp and beaten from her loss; she did not care 8
 and i'll take you with me
 the two of them against the world
 that had been how she imagined it
 for when he began to talk and dream all at the same time making his plans as he went she had begun dreaming too
 but now the dream was over
 the big waking up had happened
 what did i imagine? 18
  she thought
 did i see him about to swing low in a chariot? 8
  or maybe poling up the south fork of the forked deer river braving the wastes dumped in it? 5
  maybe i saw him on a barge with a gang of ethiopians poling it
 and i'll take you with me
 he had taken her all right
 wednesday nights after youth fellowship
 out of the church and into his big car it tooling over the road with him driving and the headlights sweeping the pike ahead and after he hit college his expansiveness the quaint little pine board tourist courts cabins really with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling like the one on the corner where you used to play when you were a kid where you watched the bats swooping in after the bugs watching a room complete with moths pinging the light and the few casual cockroaches cruising the walls an insect highway patrol with feelers waving 5
 and the bed that sagged in a certain place where all the weight had been put too many times before and the walls fine and thin for overhearing talk in the next room when gratt went out for ice the sound coming through the walls like something on the other side of the curtain so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened
 and gratt shafer would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would just like everybody knew all along
 like mattie and the mayor up there gripping the microphone and toonker burkette back in his office yanking out teeth like they all knew he would
 just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen
 or you could hope the parachute wouldn't open just so you could say you saw it not open not because you meant any harm to starkey poe in his suit of red underwear but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid- a thing which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant but must stand the dizzy feeling all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice: i think i'm pregnant
 or you could wish your daddy would really do it- kill gratt shafer like he said when you all the time all along could feel the nerve draining out of him like air out of a punctur ed tire when you are on a muddy road alone and it is raining and at night
 so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlights waiting for you for your new spectator pumps waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch tire off because that is being an old maid too if you happen to drive a car it is changing the tire yourself in the night and in the mud and the rain hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help 5
 and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains out with a tire tool so you won't tell a combination like ham and eggs rape her and kill her and that is being an old maid too
 it is not having his baby nestled warm and fat against your breast and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp cracks your skull
 and most of all it is not having the only man you could love whether he drives a bread truck or delivers the mail or checks the berry crates down at the sheds or owns seventeen oil wells and six diamond mines for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference if he is the one
 he can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town ideas and level gray eyes and a heart even houdini couldn't figure out how it is unlocked
 and he can be on the way to memphis your gratt shafer can and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him- really want him- dead
 because if you can't then nobody else can either nobody else can have him
 for you don't share him not even with god
 if it is love you don't
 and i'll take you with me
 even if that's all the promise he ever gave or ever will give the giving of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it even when it is finally the only thing in the world you have left to believe and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie
 even when he is on the way to memphis you will still have the promise resting inside you like a gift and it is he inside of you 12
 and in a way the promise works out true for whether he wants you or not you go with him in your heart
 you feel him every mile further away
 you feel where he is and what he sees and at night you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman the one that never could love him the way you do the one who got him because she didn't particularly give a damn whether she got him or didn't
 and you know you will always wonder all of your life whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you didn't get him and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy the chump who begged you to marry him the one with the plastered hair and the car he couldn't afford and the too-shiny shoes
 you think: did he feel that way about me? 9
  it comes to you that probably he did feel that way to let you use him like you did when you couldn't have gratt shafer; that he must have since he was there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him that other guy
 it dawns on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you he was a man and that because gratt shafer was making you miserable you were passing it down to him to gratt shafer's substitute that other guy
 and you wonder if that is why the little man lost his job and his car and stayed drunk about a year before he straightened out and moved to st louis where he got to be a big unhappy success 8
 you wonder if he looks at his wife now and thinks of you 8
 you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you couldn't be happy yourself to give somebody else the one they wanted- to give them you
 damn the world she thought
 she looked out at the corn field the great green deep acres of it rolled out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewashed fence bordering the grounds
 the mayor envisioned factories there
 homes and factories and schools and a big wide federal highway instead of peaceful corn to rest your eyes on while you tried to rest your heart while you tried not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniforms and the flash of the instruments
 the bands were impatient but they were the only ones 10
 the others the ones in the stands were spellbound for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony was for sophisticated folks in new york city
 it was like being in the concert hall in the afternoon and hearing the piano virtuoso rehearsing
 he was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the united states some day
 so they stayed quiet and hung not on what he said but on how he said it not listening exactly but rather feeling
 if a man was good if he was going to be governor you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever
 you were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world was something else too 6
 it was a place full of courage and hope and you were part of it 7
 you laughed and then your chest swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit and then a feeling hit you like a chill in your stomach and the goose bumps rippled along your arm
 he hit the theme about dying to defend your country and you were ready to do it right then without a second thought
 while he talked you wouldn't trade being a west tennessee farmer for being anything else in the whole damned world no matter if it hadn't in six weeks rained enough to wet a rat's ass
 she glanced at the man nodding beside her a man with weather cracks furrowed into his lean cheeks with powdery pale eyes reflecting all the droughts he had seen reflecting the sky and the drought which must follow now in august- yes with eyes predicting the drought and here it was only june only festival time again and thoughts of gratt shafer would not leave her
 i should have stayed at the store she thought 11
 back at the factory- to-you with the other old maids back there she was the youngest clerk and she was thirty-four which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions like the unventilated toilet with the door you had to hold shut while you sat down
 there was no lock because herman didn't allow a lock 14
 a lock on the toilet would encourage malingering and primping 9
 the toilet hadn't had a sincere scrubbing in years and there were things written on the walls of the little boxed-in place because you couldn't keep the public out- entirely
 she could not count the times herman had rapped on the door just a couple of bangs that shook the whole damned closet and might someday break away the pipe connections from the wall
 the two little bangs meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd of customers waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door and drag out by the opposite door handle which she would be clutching whichever-the-hell clerk it was who thought she could waste so much store time on the pot
 and the hours were six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on saturdays and during sales and there were no chairs and you couldn't smoke and the cooling was overhead fans and there was no porter or janitor
 among us we three handled quite a few small commissions from spot drawings for advertising agencies uptown to magazine work and quick lettering jobs
 each of us had his own specialty besides
 george did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink drawings like something out of a medieval miniature: hundreds of delicate details crammed into an eight- by-ten sheet and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's glass
 he also drew precise crisp spots which he sold to various literary and artistic journals the new yorker for instance or esquire 7
 i did book jackets and covers for paperback reprints: naked girls huddling in corners of dingy furnished rooms while at the doorway daring the cops to take him is the guy in shirt sleeves clutching a revolver
 the book could be the brothers karamazov but it would still have the same jacket illustration
 i remember once i did a jacket for magpie press; the book was a fine historical novel about edward 3 and i did a week of research to get the details just right: the fifteenth-century armor furnishings clothes 5
 i even ferreted out the materials from which shields were made- linden wood covered with leather- so i'd get the light reflections accurate
 mckenzie the art editor took one look at my finished sketch and said nothing doing rufus
 in the first place it's static; in the second place it doesn't look authentic; and in the third place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place- you've got six colors there including gold
 i said mr mckenzie it is as authentic as careful research can make it
 he said that may be but it isn't authentic the way readers think 8
 they know from their researches into television and the movies that knights in the middle ages had beautiful flowing haircuts like little lord fauntleroy and only the villains had beards 6
 and girls couldn't have dressed like that- it isn't transparent enough
 in the end i did the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy gave him a sword instead of a pistol and painted in furniture from the stills of a costume movie
 mckenzie was as happy as a clam
 as for donald he actually sold paintings
 we all painted in our spare time and we had all started as easel painters with scholarships but he was the only one of us who made any regular money at it
 not much; he sold perhaps three or four a year and usually all to joyce monmouth or her friends
 he had style a real inner vision of his very own 11
 it was strange stuff- it reminded me of the pictures of a child but a child who has never played with other kids and has lived all its life with adults
 there was the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of self-consciousness but with a twist that made the forms leap from the page and smack you in the eye
 we used to kid him by saying he only painted that way because he was so nearsighted
 it may have been true for all i know because his glasses were like the bottoms of milk bottles but it didn't prevent the paintings from being exciting
 he also had at times an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker; he would look right through you while you were talking to him and if you said for christ's sake donald you've got prussian blue all over your shirt he would smile and nod and an hour later the paint would be all over his pants as well
 mrs monmouth thought of him as her discovery and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a painting
 it was all gravy and donald didn't need much to live on; none of us did
 we shared the expenses of the studio and we all lived within walking distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or another 8
 attending the life class was my idea- or rather askington's idea but i was ripe for it and the other two wouldn't have gone if i hadn 't talked them into it
 i wanted to paint again
 i hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year
 it wasn't just the pressure of work although that was the excuse i often used even to myself
 it was the kind of work i was doing the quality of the ambition it awoke in me that kept me from painting
 i kept saying if i could just build up a reputation for myself make some real money get to be well known as an illustrator- like peter askington for instance- then i could take some time off and paint 6
 askington was a kind of goal i set myself; i had admired him long before i talked to him
 it looked to me as though he had everything an artist could want joy in his work standing in the profession a large and steady income 8
 the night we first met at one of mrs monmouth's giant parties he was wearing a brown cashmere jack et with silver buttons and a soft pink viyella shirt; instead of a necktie he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set a lump of pale pure jade 4
 this set his tone: richness of texture and color and another kind of richness as well for his clothing and decorations would have paid the brush-off's rent for a year
 he was fifteen years older than i- forty-four- but full of spring and sparkle
 he didn't look like what i thought of as an old man and his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger
 he was one of the most prominent magazine illustrators in america; you saw one of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazines every month
 life had included him in its modern american artists series and had photographed him at his studio in the east sixties; the corner of it you could see in the photograph looked as though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty of spain
 i had a long talk with him
 we went into mrs monmouth's library which had low bookshelves all along the walls and above them a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve feet long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that looked like an inscription from a martian tomb
 the fireplace had tiles made for mrs monmouth by picasso himself
 like certain expensive restaurants just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself
 in the course of our talk askington mentioned that he spent part of each week studying
 no i take classes with different people he said 8
 i don't think i've reached the point yet where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft
 besides it's important to the way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere an atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters as du^rer went to italy to meet bellini and mantegna
 he made a circle with his thumb and fingers
 painting isn't this big you know
 it doesn't embrace only the artist alone before his easel 7
 it is as large as all of art interdependent varied multitudinous 17
 he threw his arms wide his face shining
 the artist is like a fragment of a mosaic- no he is more than that a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic 11
 one of these days i'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being painted these days from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists have in common with each other
 the eye is all inward or outward
 ah what a title for the exhibition: the eye is all! what do you study? 6
  i asked
 i was fascinated; just listening to him made me feel intelligent 9
 i'm studying anatomy with burns he replied
 he teaches at the manhattan school of art
 i had studied with burns ten years before during the scholarship year the manhattan gave me along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on hudson street
 burns and i had not loved each other
 i'm also studying enameling with hajime iijima he went on and twice a week i go to a life class taught by pendleton
 my god is he still alive? 8
  he must be a million years old
 i went to a retrospective of his work when i was eighteen and i thought he was a contemporary of cezanne's
 he's about sixty now
 still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful canvases of mountains and farms
 he even makes the city look like one of thoreau's hangouts 10
 i've always admired him and when i heard he was taking a few pupils i went to him and joined his class
 yes it sounds great i said but suppose you don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter? 7
    you're missing the point he said
 he has the magical eye
 and he is a great man
 contact with him is stimulating
 and that's the trouble with so many artists today 8
 they sit alone in their rooms and try to paint and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life
 that's one of the reasons art is becoming a useless occupation 5
 in the middle ages in the renaissance right up to the early nineteenth century the painter was a giant in the world 11
 he was an artisan a man who studied his trade and developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did
 he filled a real need showing society what it looked like turning it inside out portraying its wars and its leaders its ugliness and its beauties reflecting its profound religious impulses 7
 he was a propagandist- they weren't afraid of the word then- satirist nature lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party and of no party
 but look at us today! we hold safe little jobs illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity
 a bunch of amateur dervishes! what we need is to get back to the group to learning and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school 7
 the upshot of the evening was that i got the address of pendleton's studio- or rather of the studio in which he gave his classes for he didn't work there himself- and join ed the life class which met every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve in the morning 6
 it was an awkward hour but i didn't have to punch any time clock and it only meant that sometimes i had to stay a couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job
 after a short time both george and donald joined the class with me so they wouldn't feel lonely and we used to hang a sign on the door of the brush-off reading out to work
 it was mostly for the benefit of the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visited us
 in a way askington was right
 stimulating was the word for it
 i don't know that it was always as rewarding as i had expected it to be
 partly it was because pendleton himself wasn't what i anticipated 6
 i had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars 9
 no that isn't quite fair
 actually there was a lot of force in him which is why i kept on in that class instead of quitting after a week
 such a little thing to start with- the car registration 8
 ida where is the car license? 9
  she asked
 i can't find it in the glove compartment
 via must have it i answered readily enough recalling her last visit
 why should via have it? 16
    had she forgotten she had signed the car away that whatever they mutually owned had been divided among the children? 5
    i was silent
 i didn't want to stir things up
 i drive my own car by courtesy of via? 11
    i'm sure she'd turn it over to you if you'd rather 3
 she looked as if she were accusing me of some fraud 12
 she must have taken the registration when she went to walter's 10
 no thank you
 i want nothing of via's
 why should this suddenly assail her? 16
  walter was giving me checks for my pay the household bills 6
 had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped her mind? 9
    what a fool i've been she said quietly
 i knew all this but i paid no attention
 i don't even own the house i'm standing in
 i was so sure it was all temporary h that we would all embrace and then the lawyer would tear up all those things h   it narrows down down down and finally there is no way out
 if i am not to be mrs salter i am nothing
 i suppose i should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge in
 i love you i hate you i feel like killing you and myself and in the same sequence i love you i think you're the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on meanwhile eating a good breakfast and dinner and enjoying living
 so i went about my business
 i made a lemon sponge a light dessert roasted a chicken parboiled some frozen vegetables so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend
 don't bother ida she said
 i have these appointments in town for saturday and i'll probably spend sunday with dolly or the thaxters
 at last i thought she's recovering her spirits 14
 with this movie- to-be in london and new faces about her there she would soon be a more tranquil a wiser person all the better for her stay out here
 i felt more cheerful as if i had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself
 and i went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch of life
 it was foggy that evening but the path to my house was so well grooved that i could feel my way accustomed as i was to the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river and sometimes last for days
 in the morning the fog was still thick so that to go to the village i crept along with my headlights full on
 i did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the woods but as i had left a light on in my own house because of the fog i assumed mrs salter had done the same before she left for town
 i did my shopping had my dentist appointment and from there i went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed plans for the annual christmas bazaar so that dusk was beginning to gather when i drove home in the late afternoon
 but the next day- sunday
 why when i drove down to church didn't it speak to me seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear? 6
  prisoners brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot remember and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe that the mind can remove absent itself unsee 5
 when i came back from church at noon mrs thaxter was turning into the salter driveway
 even at a car's length i could sense that something was wrong and so i followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house 8
 dolly engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came running toward us
 she's nowhere nowhere! she screamed and both women ran up to the house and i followed
 the search began in all the rooms running upstairs down opening closets talking exclaiming in rushes and gasps
 everything was as i had left it the night before last- her portfolio and bag for town her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out h only her mink coat was missing
 i who until that day before had been mrs salter's friend her equal was the servant now
 it was dolly and mrs thaxter who were calling via everybody 13
 and when they spoke they spoke to each other and not to me 12
 and after i brought them sandwiches and coffee i had to go back to my place in the kitchen and wait
 sitting in the kitchen i recalled every word mrs salter said that could have been a sign to me
 if i am not to be mrs salter then i am nothing 14
 why didn't that alarm me then? 9
  and when she returned from taking her guests back to new york she had said all they talked about was harvie h harvie this harvie that h when they know the truth will they drop away from me will i become a nothing? 6
  and then i remembered a few years before after their return from a short trip to rome i had heard her boast over and over again on the boat people liked me for myself
 i had made a habit of calling her at night from my cottage just to check
 the last night i had called but the line was always busy and it reassured me
 i assumed it was one of those hour-long conversations with dolly or constance she comfortable in bed
 but it seemed not from what they were saying 13
 then was it a final desperate plea from her to whom? 8
  h hanging on and on past any man's patience h some final stab of conclusion? 6
  she was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff 12
 i tried to believe that what must have happened was that restless disturbed by this telephone call or whatever she walked out in the night as she had a habit of doing
 sometimes she took the path that winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff
 it's so romantic up there she used to say with the broad river gleaming in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of the night so poetic
 with all that warm rain and the fog it might have been as simple as a loosened rock a misstep
 but i didn't really think it was as simple as that nor did anyone else
 when a fisherman brought her up in his arms still small as if she were a child asleep i began to shudder with a terrible excitement almost triumphant that i still cannot account for
 was it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks? 7
  that at last the vigilance the will gives way? 12
  or what was it that before via sonny walter and all i began almost to dance with shuddering and cry out i knew she'd do it! i knew!   everyone stared at me and drew back
 their eyes turned cold and accusing even via's 10
 and they have never changed
 at the same time that i thought i understood her at long last and pitied her underneath this knowing had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate an enduring envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry? 7
  was that what had given way in me? 8
  even now i am appalled at how little anyone knows of what they really are
 it is absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged me from the family i considered my very own but there it hangs a cooling void that broke our close connection with each other 6
 at the time i was filled with self-pity at this separation but in the years since i have come to understand that the sight of me was painful to them after that outcry
 in my person they would always remember that last long time of me alone with her so if they told themselves that i could have prevented it i can understand that by now and love them still because everyone must justify have a scapegoat for what is not to be borne 5
 it is not their avoidance that rankles; it is when i meet someon e who was a close friend of the family and therefore of mine and they nod to me so coolly and walk away that it hurts
 i could tell them but no one ever asked why i had cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body
 no i forget mrs mathias who had been away visiting a married daughter when it happened
 she haunted me; she persisted in explaining how and why she had advised mrs salter to return to the country
 we all feel guilty i turned away from her coldly 8
 she overplayed her hand
 what do you mean? 32
  she frowned
 why put such a high value on being top dog? 10
  i added
 it was coarse almost insulting this harsh appraisal and she has never come to see me since
 but suppose she had not taken mrs mathias' advice and lived on like thousands of women in towns dispossessed of love hanging on to makeshifts and altogether and finally arid
 if she chose and in that final decision discarded what above all all of us value life itself must she not have risen to her fullest height and transcending her murky self felt at last the passion of a great moral decision? 7
  if they say i could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks of self-examination her search into herself and its conclusions
 yes i had cried out that i knew she'd do it but without my fully realizing it at the time it was a cry of triumph for her praise at her deliverance from pettiness and greed- and guilt 7
 she w as finally at rest in truth of her own proud free choice 6
 at rest with my darling ellen the first mrs salter 10
 the funeral service was in the house the methodist minister how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing beside that coffin with that doll inside a stranger speaking to strangers the old sacred words and the rain drumming incessantly in accompaniment seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to mud so the burial had to be postponed
 then via called to say they had decided to cremate her- as they had ellen the thought leaped to my mind- and did i want to meet her at the funeral home the next morning
 the coffin stood on trestles in a corner of the long low dimly lit funeral parlor on its dark shining surface the sheaf of white roses i had ordered
 i knelt just for decency i thought at the time but found myself whispering our father which art in heaven h and it was only after that that something unlocked in me and i felt a grief
 via was in the parking lot when i went outside
 together we waited in her car until the hearse moved out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey
 by the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet symbols of religious faiths
 again i felt impelled to kneel and reached back and pulled via down
 something would come into her heart h if nothing else the sounds of bach would give her some healing
 i had a rather small place of my own
 a nice bachelor apartment in a place called the lancaster arms
 uhhu she said hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid 8
 and then i had another place farther downtown i used as a studio 7
 i'm not a man who has many close intimate friends carla he said wanting her to know all about him
 oh i'd drink with newspaper people
 i think i was what you might call a convivial man and yet it was when i was alone in my studio doing my work that i really felt alive 9
 but i think a man needs at least one intimate friend to communicate with
 pausing he waited for her to turn to ask a question 8
 she showed no interest at all in the life he had led back home and it hurt him a little
 well what about you carla? 15
    me? 15
  she asked turning slowly
 what about me? 16
    did you make friends easily? 14
  umm uhhu
 somehow i imagine that as you grew up you were alone a lot 7
 how about it? 18
    i guess so she said taking a kleenex from her purse 10
 when she had wiped some of the lipstick from her mouth she stared solemnly at her image in the mirror
 are your people still alive? 16
  he asked trying to touch a part of her life alberto hadn't discussed; so he could have something of her for himself 8
 you talk so well carla he went on
 you seem to have read so much you have a natural gift for words he added trying to flatter her vanity
 you must have been good at history at school 14
 where did you go to school? 9
  what is this? 13
  she asked turning suddenly
 don't you know all about me by this time? 7
  my name's carla caneli
 i sleep with you
 you know something more about me every day don't you? 10
  would you be happier if i made up some stories about my life told you some lies? 9
  why are you trying to worry me? 10
    i'm not trying to worry you
 the cleansing tissues she had been using had been falling on the floor and he got up and picked up one then another hoping she would notice what he was doing
 at home he had been a clean orderly man and now he had to hide his annoyance
 was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance? 7
  he wondered
 would he have to clean up after her every day clean the kitchen the bathroom and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen floor then hang up her dresses pick up her stockings make the bed while she lay around? 5
  he straightened up ready to vent his exasperation then grew afraid
 if he dwelt on the indignities he suffered he would lose all respect for her and without the respect he might lose his view of her too
 what's the matter? 9
  she asked suddenly
 nothing at all he said quietly
 are those the only shoes you have sam? 8
  what's the matter with them? 11
    the heavy thick soles
 they're an expensive english shoe for walking around a lot 5
 sam no one around here wears such heavy soles
 can't you get another pair? 11
    maybe i could he said surprised that she could turn from herself and notice anything about him
 i'll get an elegant pair of thin-soled italian shoes tomorrow carla
 and i don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit she said making a face
 what's the matter with it? 8
  he had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in rome when he had encountered her on the street
 you look like a tweedy englishman
 can't you wear something else and look a little more as though you belonged? 5
    i don't mind at all he said delighted with her attention 6
 changing his clothes he put on his dark-blue flannel suit and laid away the gray jacket with the feeling that he might be putting it aside for good
 but it was a hopeful sign he told himself
 she no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in parioli 5
 that day they loafed around just getting the feel of the city 10
 they looked at the ruins of the old roman wall on the lower via veneto then they went to the farnese gardens
 she had some amusing scandal about the farneses in the old days
 then they took a taxi to trastevere
 there's a church you should see she said
 and when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at santa maria he had to keep a straight face not letting on he had been there with alberto
 he let her tell him all about the church
 all evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself 7
 when they got home at midnight she was tired out 11
 and in the morning when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing
 he had never heard so many bells and as he lay there listening he thought of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish steps 8
 it was a good thing that she clung to her religion he thought 11
 she might like to take him to st peter's 10
 carla wake up he said shaking her
 aren't you going out to mass? 7
  you could take me to st peter's
 come on you'll be late
 i think i'll sleep in this morning she said drowsily and as she snuggled against him he wondered if she ever went to church 5
 why did he want her to go to church? 15
  he wondered h probably because it was a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security
 it would be good for her
 it was too bad he had no feeling himself for church 11
 not his poor mother's fault
 she would have been better off if she had stuck to her bible 8
 as for himself he just didn't have the temperament for it 11
 from the time he had been at college he had achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that there were certain things he could never know
 then he thought of those old testament figures on the ceiling of the sistine chapel
 just figures out of a tribal folklore
 could he honestly believe it would be good for carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination now? 7
  being a woman though she would take only what she needed from church
 it was too bad he wasn't a catholic himself 15
 or a protestant or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists or a strict orthodox communist
 what was the matter with him that they all wearied him? 12
  it was the times he was sure
 all the ideologies changing from day to day right under his eyes so how could a man look to any one of them for an enlargement of his freedom? 6
  it was all too wearying
 but where? 29
  just the same he thought pondering over it it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she got up and went to church 7
 a half hour later he got her up to go out for breakfast so the ferraros hearing them hurrying down the stairs would think they were going to a late mass
 it seemed to him that if the ferraros felt sure of them could place them it would help him to feel more sure of himself with carla 6
 since we're having coffee with them this afternoon he said i think i'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us
 and he waited for her to say oh no i can do it sam 8
 there's so little to do
 i'm not good at that kind of thing
 this afternoon let's take an air with them
 let's be fine superior people of great dignity he said as if he were joking
 if you find it necessary sam go ahead she said turning on the stair
 i am what i am
 her words remained with him worrying him for hours 9
 he didn't know how she would behave with other people 5
 when they walked into the ferraro apartment the old lady bowing and smiling said softly
 ciao and put out her hand
 her little brown face wrinkled up her brown eyes gleamed and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things 6
 agnese smiling too said 'ello and then more slowly i am happy
 and they sat down and began their little coffee party 11
 the ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee 8
 acting only as interpreter carla her hands folded on her lap was utterly impersonal
 she would turn to them then turn to him then turn again 7
 watching her he felt like a spectator at a tennis game with the ball being bounced back and forth
 signora ferraro bobbing her head encouragingly asked sam about canada having a special interest
 the old woman had a nephew from north italy a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment and who had migrated to canada to work on the railway
 for a year the boy had lived in the bush in a boxcar 13
 did many of sam's countrymen live in boxcars in the bush? 8
  had sam ever lived in a boxcar? 8
  she wanted to know
 regretfully sam explained that he had no experience with boxcars
 just the same the old woman said she would write to her nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted country
 and sam thanked her and hoped he might meet her nephew back home and asked her if she had any further news of the pope
 a very great pope this one the old woman explained her black eyes sparkling
 it was said that he had had a vision
 just as thousands that day in portugal had seen the sun dancing in the sky he had seen the same thing later in his own garden and she turned to agnese for confirmation
 agnese had been sitting quietly listening with the serenity of the unaware
 now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in her eyes
 the holy father would die soon she said to carla so she could translate for sam although he had a brilliant doctor a man who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great rulers of the world
 yes the pope could die and quickly be made a saint 10
 no he was indeed a saint now
 nodding approvingly and swelling with importance the old lady whispered confidentially
 there was a certain discontent among the cardinals 12
 the pope in the splendor of his great intellect had neglected them a little
 there would be changes made and signor raymond should understand that when the pope died it was like the end of a regime in rome
 jobs would be lost and new faces would become prominent 8
 did signor raymond understand? 11
  indeed he did sam said solemnly trying to get carla's eye 7
 surely she could see that these women were her italians too he thought
 devout orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in brooklyn or malta or ireland
 but carla; eyes were on agnese whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness
 and carla watching in wonder turned to sam
 it means so much to her
 it's like a flame i guess she said in a dreamy tone 4
 but one night dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's lodge where shades of night had gone to purify herself 7
 with the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill caressing the flageolet with his lips making it whisper 6
 he saw her emerge suddenly coming in her unhesitant fashion her back stiff her head erect facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach
 in her dark scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination afraid of nothing not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding
 seeing her come he caught his breath feeling his heart bounce in him and turned away afraid now
 even he wanting her afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit feared the evil presences in her metabolism more 7
 his breath caught and trembling he closed his eyes and stumbled off
 going he saw as often before some queer hideous yellow face over his head shining and weird like the old images which had invested him at other times like those that appear sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs
 he cried out to her his back turned
 then he fled not waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry
 but she heard him go
 yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly her neck tall as she looked in his direction and continued on her way toward the end of the camp
 elsewhere others heard and stopped and waited the women peering from their lodges then gathering in small curious clusters 5
 early spring came from her bed from beside her half-drunk husband walitzee and stood at the entrance way to her lodge hearing the mild commotion the sound of hushed voices
 standing there she saw shades of night come through the trees and stop beside the lodge silent almost imperious her body taut simply standing without speaking or moving while the wife of walitzee waited perhaps denying the dread that moved in her
 when at last she could suffer the insult no longer nor face the girl's scorn she said in a voice overloud:   i shall call your father! go back where you can bring no harm or i will go and get the old man from his bed so he can see your shame!   but the girl said only tell him i am here that i have come
 and it was not pile of clouds she meant
 but now with real anger at last something proud and indignant early spring stood like a she wolf before her den and cried i will not shriek at you! i will tell you to go not begging 6
 telling you! and unsheathing the knife she used for curing hides she stepped away from the lodge holding the knife at her side 5
 you bring only wickedness she said and it was not to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal
 speaking in a low voice of loathing she went up to the girl who stood with the same upright scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife
 go take helsq'iyokom your evil spirit to the young boys the woman said
 they do not have to face battle
 i will not let your evil in
 i will simply kill you first
 now go!   the other women had come close now their voices murmuring together until they stood buzzing in an angry knot their threats mingling rising nagging at each other each trying to make her indignation and anger felt
 they picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl 9
 the sticks fell like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny points of pain along her thighs 7
 they were all shouting at her as if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought
 but she did not move taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme youth until suddenly pile of clouds came howling among them swinging a great bullhide whip
 go back to your lodges! he shouted
 a pack of dogs makes less noise! he made the long whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming some tripping over themselves in their flight
 and early spring seized the whip and said:   if you must flog someone let it be her your daughter
 drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay away from my husband! but the old man turned on her jerking the whip from her hand 5
 get into your hovel! he spat
 go back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body among the young women
 keep him back if you must tell me what to do
 i will be the one to confront my daughter not the wife of him who leads her to sin!   she retreated before the naked shame in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her lodge where walitzee stirred mumbling sitting up in a half stupor to say:   what worrisome thing happens? 0
  i thought i dreamed of wolves fighting
 but she went to him and pressed herself against his nakedness smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had stolen from tuhulhulzote 9
 she said there is nothing that concerns you here 11
 lie back and go to sleep
 do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain 11
 he sank back sighing and was soon asleep again 11
 outside the old man beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore went to her and twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent out a thousand arms 4
 and shoving her against a spruce her back to him he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp air shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound of it snarled and cracked settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders while she stood as unchanged as dark and motionless as ever her eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close to her face 5
 she said to him her father how was i begotten in pain or joy? 8
  is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made grow on me? 12
  they all know your foolish name!   she stared at the pale tracings on the tree hearing her breath refracted from it her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark
 she felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables words which had no meaning like unnnt! h sssshoo! the sounds of an animal in rage and despair
 suddenly the lash stopped fighting the air and she heard pile of clouds say in his high quavering voice:   did you follow me to see my shame? 5
  move from the line or i will settle the whip on you h 7
 move! do you hear the anger of the whip's whine? 6
    turning the girl saw dookiyoon standing between his narrow shoulders unbent his arms hanging long and resigned
 he said let me take her blows for there are demons in me too 0
 then without knowing why she found herself running from them fleeing wildly through the trees dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry
 for a while the young men waited outside the lodge of tu hul hul zote glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself 6
 he shouted like a hoarse old mastiff his hair stiff and bristling 9
 he ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies walking in circles in and out of his living place drinking stolen whisky in great gasping draughts until finally incoherent and sick he fell into his own oblivion
 he amused the young men who had been silent long enough 13
 but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through his antics
 now they moved rubbing their flesh alive again disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them
 they came out and held their games and races
 it was they who held the future in their hands 15
 they went into the sun together and paraded grandly in their war clothes painting their faces with the sacred attis dug far off in the cave of skeletons
 they danced the paxam wildly at night the war dance and dipped their arrowheads in the venom of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers firing their few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal
 walitzee was among them and sarpsis and they wore red blankets which flew like broad wings in the air of their passing 5
 and a very young one swan necklace tried to emulate them and followed timidly
 yellow wolf was there nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked
 he would spring bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction because something had boiled over in his fermenting juices 8
 all the young men alokut among them challenged them in matched racing
 they raced and maneuvered for war swinging their horses in single file and then abreast like cavalry
 at times they would ride frenziedly through the camp letting the women see their courage how handsome they were in their regalia 6
 then again they would stand in circles making other preparations
 they combed their hair and streaked it at the part and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood rigid like the tails of sage hens making love
 walitzee whitened his leggings with clay knowing the girl watched from her place in the trees
 he saw himself in a superior reflection and he was as a speeding arrow from the taut bow hurtling with a mad grace his maleness shining and scented with meadow rue
 he was always aware of the women's eyes which followed him admiring him
 and the suspicious envenomed eyes of pile of clouds 10
 and those of early spring haunted and now full of hurt and envy
 he felt so much like laughing; even like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs
 he and sarpsis planned a great parade with the young men 11
 they would give one final testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance
 they would ride with streaming amulets their colors ripening in the sun shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death
 and so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was the young men's blood shifting then into the full heat and outcry which ran with their hearts
 they mounted their horses and rode off into the hills 11
 the young chief stared at the wall of his lodge listening 8
 the sound rose on the other side of the hills vanished and rose again and he could imagine the mad disheveled hoofs of the appaloosas horses the white men once had called the dogs of hell
 he saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across the ridge
 standing then with the others peering into the sun he saw the bright multicolored legion their hair flying like dark banners only the thunder the roll of drums the mad cacophony of the hoofs accompanying them
 they leaned into the wind and seemed like one thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted ejaculated their grotesque cry of war
 she was moving through a screen of hemlocks in among the white birch and maples
 the sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her ears 7
 she stood once more listening
 she had never been here at this hour
 she felt as if some dark totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at her arm; but she found the path she always used the stubs of branches she had broken those she had pushed aside; and she walked easily now and more slowly until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath her
 if i ever committed suicide she thought i would dive straight down from here- and no one would find me for days
 she smiled and expertly let herself downward holding this known root or that her sneakers sliding in the leaves
 she jumped out onto the flat expanse of rock and seating herself shook her short-cut brown hair and tilted her chin far upward 5
 the reedy music of the frogs had faded but presently it began again growing in volume until it was vibrant
 julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped her hands tightly around the bent knees
 she had accomplished a miracle
 the hour couldn't change it h
 only- only- her thoughts were a little strange 9
 perhaps it was because it was so late and because she had no business to be here now
 she was thinking of paul a few weeks ago in the easter holidays with her at one of those awful friday evening dancing class parties her mother had made her attend
 hello julie how are you? 8
  h and then off he went so casually to someone else with breasts better developed more obvious in a lower-cut dress someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability to find words that would hold him
 i wish he was with me now she thought and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once only pretense and acute embarrassment
 oh god! i wish i were older or younger julia bentley thought 8
 i wish so much someone loved me
 george rawlings remembered seeing the door open sometime during the night- millie in a white robe standing like a ghost at the threshold
 she had vanished; he must have slept again 10
 he was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him 10
 it seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch; but of course the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this monday morning
 this room was like a prison
 he would not be indebted to sam! below him as if at the end of some remote tunnel he heard the humming of a vacuum cleaner 8
 his fingers fumbled across the bandages
 they had left both of his eyes uncovered h
 well he told himself let's put the show on the road 9
 he was walking across to the bathroom
 he drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with both hands 10
 a fearful pain had come from his head as if the water were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them h 6
 he recognized his jacket and trousers
 the fabric was dark; the stains weren't too apparent; and there were his shoes thank god but his shirt was one terrible mess 5
 he shivered and then tore away the blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf
 sam would be amazed to find him gone
 millie would have to understand
 she must have put his clothes in the closet
 he found a lump rising in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness
 he was on the verge of tears
 alex poldowski- in a fashion he owed a debt to that effete gentleman
 at least alex had told him he wasn't dying
 perhaps george rawlings would be better off dead 13
 what time was it? 10
  he peered at his wristwatch
 strange it was still running
 too early for a vacuum cleaner but probably sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs
 he was kneeling to tie his shoelaces
 his fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy
 he rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door
 this was some freak two strands of adhesive tape across his nose like ugly roots from the mass of gauze suddenly moist over his cheekbones
 the surface however was perfectly white
 he was drinking another glass of water
 it was after seven o'clock
 he was supposed to be in court this afternoon at city hall 18
 who would take over? 12
  he'd have to think but the main thing the imperative necessity was to leave before sam bentley was up and about and before millie detained him with sympathy
 he was actually walking down the stairs
 a plane up in the sky above the clouds and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away
 father is that you? 10
  the voice issued from the cavern of the hall below 11
 is that you father? 13
  h who's there? 17
  for a moment he felt like a thief discovered 6
 then julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room
 she stood gazing at him
 uncle george!   he was trying to smile at her 10
 gosh! you shouldn't be up should you? 7
  i- i was just leaving here julie h
 just about to call a taxi
 she was wearing some sort of gray blazer
 she seemed overly tall her brow knitted in concern 7
 well at least you won't have to do that she was saying 11
 i'm about to leave myself
 you're leaving? 19
    i'm going back to school she answered
 i'm just finishing breakfast h
 but have you told mother you were going? 7
  she asked him
 i just don't want anyone disturbed julie
 it's quite a big one he added
 her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight
 well won't you come in then have a cup of coffee- or something? 9
  h or maybe a drink? 11
  she asked in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated considerate and yet perhaps partly scornful
 he tried to see her face more clearly
 no- nothing at all he said after a moment's hesitation 10
 i'll just wait for you here
 he leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids 7
 julia moved past
 i have to say good-by upstairs
 as a great favor julie he said please don't mention you've seen me
 not to anyone? 22
  no- please h
 i'll call your mother as soon as i get home
 it'll be so much easier
 all right h she was staring at him
 please you just go ahead
 he could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages 13
 he imagined sam's voice: george what the hell goes on? 8
  i wouldn't have the strength to answer he thought 11
 maybe i couldn't have called a taxi
 he could hear the footsteps overhead
 he saw the suitcase which julia was holding 12
 i'll take that julie- for you
 i can manage
 she went ahead of him
 outside the lincoln was parked
 he could hardly believe he was getting in
 pietro was gazing at him in an insolent disdainful fashion; but that didn't matter
 we'll drop mr rawlings off in ardmore julia said and for the merest second george was reminded of her father's tone with servants 6
 to the manner born- odd to have such a thought at a time like this; yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed
 he could not stop to analyze
 he had never felt particularly close to her
 carrie seemed more affectionate but obviously julia had respected his request
 i wish i didn't have to go back to school she said and then i wish you lived in new york
 that's in the opposite direction
 i wish i did he responded
 i wish i wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume and that we could go to a theater together or a nice restaurant forget we knew h he stopped speaking
 forget we ever knew what? 8
  oh just sort of everything in general
 she said nothing until pietro had slackened their pace 6
 i know you feel badly but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say
 i'm supposed to joke about things aren't i? 4
  h but sometimes life can be rather a disappointing business 9
 his voice seemed thick and purposeless
 he could see the stone building where he lived
 just a few more steps h
 abruptly he reached into his pocket
 yes there was the key
 are you positive you'll be all right by yourself? 13
  she asked him
 for a moment he smiled
 you've done me the greatest possible service 5
 by myself i'll be fine
 take care of yourself then
 you also h
 it was an automatic phrase; as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it
 he should have discovered a more tender farewell 13
 someone shouted at him well! will you look at george rawlings! what happened to you? 6
    i bumped into a door handle george said 12
 george walked steadily ahead into his entry
 his bandages seemed on fire
 he had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it 8
 in the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp 14
 just one or two swallows he told himself enough to lessen some of the pain
 no millie i'm home h
 no really right as rain h
 tell sam not to worry about the car
 i'll get it hauled away h
 no please- no visit today- i'll be asleep h
 for god's sake don't worry
 that upsets me more than anything h
 yes sure i'll see the doctor- this evening if you insist h 6
 there was one more call to make
 joan did i wake you? 9
  he asked
 yes i thought you'd probably be up h
 look sweethea rt some fool was h
 happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night 7
 unfortunately it turned out to be me but i wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss h
 oh hell no i'm not in a hospital
 i won't be in town for a couple of days though and there's that case i was supposed to handle this afternoon
 too bad a jury isn't involved
 i might struggle in for a jury
 but i thought maybe tony elliott could pinch-hit for me 9
 he'll understand- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge 7
 he's got all the facts
 i wouldn't want to ask for a postponement- it's really just a routine thing h
 what? 15
  h no darling i'd rather you didn't come out 10
 a smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape 7
 i'll see you wednesday
 i'll bribe you with a nice- he was about to say double martini but thought better of it
 i'll take you out to dinner
 okay? 15
  h he had put down the receiver
 a strange relationship between joan fulbright and himself 8
 who knew about it? 15
  she lived alone in the older part of the city in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed 7
 she had two tiny rooms on the second floor
 she was a clever girl a most efficient secretary 11
 she let him come and go as he pleased or as it pleased her 8
 in the office you might have thought them only casual friends; yet if he said: make an excuse yourself come out here today she would have been on the next train- and similarly if she had been in need he would have gone to her
 they make us conformists look good
 that's a peculiar way to think
 it wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers of course; she knew that
 it was jim's little sister myra the unreliable irresponsible forever flyaway myra
 she's a year older than i am lucy told herself
 come come jim said jollying lucy a little
 susan ready? 18
    lucy listened
 upstairs busy feet showering like raindrops pattered around her room
 susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days but even at seven she was a prudent soul; she always packed for a lifetime just in case
 every doll in the house must be going with her 10
 she'd better step on it
 it's a long way to websterville
 jim's fine young face was an expressive one too; as he looked at her it registered anxiety
 myra wanted me to thank you for taking cathy 10
 it'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in paris- but even so she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful 6
 lucy did not believe him; myra appreciated nothing 11
 jim had put the thanks in his sister's mouth
 darling- she said and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend
 she should have told me herself
 and will it be only a couple of weeks? 11
  remember what happened the last time? 9
  leaving cathy with them myra had gone out to the coast for a supposedly brief visit; but she had stayed all winter and cathy had stayed all winter too- with them
 lucy suspected that myra would never have come home if gregg myra's husband hadn't gone out to fetch her
 that was an awfully long two weeks
 for an otherwise silent moment jim's keys jingled nervously in his pocket
 but she promised- this will be different he said at last 14
 you've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there- she'll get a home for herself and cathy in no time
 you'll see myra's settling down
 on the defensive he added i wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without greg to be a new widow a young widow 6
 it depends on the widow
 lucy had an idea that myra loved it
 and not for one moment did she believe that myra had settled down 7
 it seemed to lucy that all their married life she and jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life
 remembering that succession of disasters she now considered cathy an ominous child-cloud on her horizon
 it was not that she disliked cathy
 the youngster drew her troubled her depths; whenever lucy saw her she tried without noise or fuss to give her the warmth she had never had from myra
 but cathy was myra's responsibility not hers 11
 i wouldn't even be surprised she said unhappily if myra tried to leave her with us forever
 myra loved big cities; thousands of miles away- in paris of all places- she might forget she had ever been a mother
 lucy knew her too well to find it impossible
 that's a horrible thing to accuse her of! jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-cathy
 he went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up fiercely susan! susan! get moving!   a startled piping sound returned 11
 don't yell at us lucy said
 was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon-washed river? 8
  their arms around each other they had been talking of the present and the future; their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm as steeped in light as the air around them
 then from within the still sleeping house the telephone had rung; myra with her news was on the other end of the line 7
 jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her 7
 his dark brows which had been lowered in anger smoothed 9
 there isn't a chance of myra's letting anything like that happen
 but they weren't just friends lucy thought; they were husband and wife and myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage 7
 the only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless selfish sister of his
 lucy was sick of it
 well at last she said because susan was clattering down the stairs 6
 susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse; her arms were straining with a burden of dolls
 do you need that big bundle? 12
  jim said
 his voice had sharp edges as though he knew very well lucy and he were not friends at the moment
 all that junk? 21
    susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief; to her each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart 4
 now now lucy said approaching susan with a handkerchief mopping skillfully
 your father didn't mean it susan
 she gave jim a quick shape-up look of warning 12
 he'll take every one of them
 jim groaned but he lifted susan's suitcase and said in a gentler tone sure- the entire thousand
 and when you get back from grandma's cathy will be here to play with you
 nice? 19
    no susan said grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a scrooge-like effect
 and at this point lucy thought there should be a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls- but she could sympathize with susan; there ought to be a limit to sharing too
 that was one more reason she didn't look forward to cathy's visit short or long; the last one had been a lilliputian war 7
 she suspected that cathy had been competing with susan for attention that she had never had
 well jim said out of the silence let's get going dolls and all
 when the car with susan's hands waving wildly from the rear window disappeared down the driveway lucy stood looking after its pale dust
 the day was brilliant around her- flower-scented crisp with breeze- yet her inner turmoil darkened it
 she had let jim go with a chilly good-by a chillier kiss 10
 she was sorry and angry at herself because never in their life together had she done that
 she turned and began to walk toward the house 13
 at the feeding station the raffish group of cowbirds again bobbed and gobbled over the ground but now gorgeous among them was a beautiful red cardinal radiant in its feathered vestments 5
 the handsome bird was solitary; its mate must be at home silently guarding their nest
 she had better stay there lucy thought; the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels
 well lucy? 22
  she said to herself abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds 9
 she had a day of things to do; among them she had to prepare the guest room
 how long would it be occupied? 11
  she wondered with a baffled feeling of helplessness 9
 as long as the unscrupulous myra chose? 19
  for a moment her mind returned again to the strange flying world of birds and she said to herself
 it isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's nests h
 in the sunshine of late afternoon lucy stood looking at the ready guest room
 there were new yellow curtains bright as a child's life ought to be a new bedspread lively with hopping rabbits and hanging from the ceiling was an airy mother goose mobile spinning slowly in the breeze 6
 a row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet; since myra had always put most of greg's money on her own back lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed
 the closet was faintly fragrant with lavender and as lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind like a lavender ghost: greg's house on the day he was buried and the child pale silent baffled watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes
 many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her
 out in the hall the upstairs phone shrilled and the small ghost vanished
 when she picked up the receiver her mother's cheerful voice was there
 websterville junction calling she said
 i just thought i'd let you know
 myra dropped cathy this morning and jim picked cathy up and left susan a few hours ago
 i'd have phoned sooner but i've been busy
 i can imagine! susan was an active character; for mother to be able to call susan must be napping now surrounded by her multitude of dolls
 lucy drew out the chair and sat down; she relaxed a little and some of the tension went out of her
 you could think yourself as grown up as methuselah yet th e maternal voice still kept its comforting magic
 but myra was the merriest widow i ever saw
 on her way to the airport on her way to paris- you bet lucy said to herself
 i've been fixing up the guest room for cathy
 there was a momentary pause and then her mother said how long is she supposed to stay? 8
    just for a couple of weeks till myra finds a place for them 12
 well- this time there was a long silence while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life
 puzzled lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper; her mother was forthright; she was not usually given to mysterious silences 6
 was she thinking along the same lines lucy was- that it was quite possible cathy might be left with her for good? 5
  you mean once myra gets to paris? 9
  once the soft pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted? 7
    suddenly seekingly lucy asked mother do you know something i don't know? 8
  again there was that curious pause and then her mother said i guess i do
 just before myra left- she was saying good- by to cathy and she didn't realize i was near
 she hesitated as though hunting over words and ways of putting them
 cathy was in tears of course and i heard myra say 'now be good and at christmastime i'll send you a wonderful present from paris' 6
 shocked speechless lucy sat there
 then she jumped to her feet the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake
 christmastime! then it was no bogey she had dreamed up; it was only too true
 myra had no intention whatever of sending for cathy in two weeks 8
 for a moment anger darkened the hallway about her and when she found her voice anger thickened it
 that does it! she said
 i'll keep cathy for two weeks
 then if myra does nothing about fetching her i'll pack he r right back to her mother- if i have to take her myself! her hand tightened on the receiver
 and that's what i'm going to tell jim
 for lucy the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end 8
 as she hung up she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds' wings and heard their grotesque singing 5
 cowbird myra! she's not going to get away with it 11
 cathy is tired lucy thought watching them come slowly up the path 6
 the child's thin legs were plodding
 she trudged along slowly both hands clutching a tired teddy bear
 she was at the moment just a small walking package being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's house
 unlike susan she was traveling light; the worn teddy bear a tiny suitcase that jim carried and the clothes she wore were all she had 5
 lucy glancing at the miniature case knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays; they would have to buy things for her
 unimpressed the dog plopped on the sand
 quint couldn't blame maggie for disbelieving 10
 for eleven days they'd done the same thing leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast before esperanza beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards
 the swirling sand made quint's limp more pronounced 10
 they walked slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages- eleven lemon nine mint seven orange- around the curve to a deserted stand with an eats sign jiggling in the wind
 now they were in friendly territory
 nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge
 his rock was to the right of a v-shaped inlet a big brown lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers
 his rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here
 here he was enclosed and safe
 along didn't he have a red swiss hunting knife on his belt- ten here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe 5
 he was canute controlling the waves
 he was a knight of the round table sir quintus the brave slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses
 he was the first astronaut on the moon chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature
 he was six feet one like his father with big hands and a hairy chest a man the weak and persecuted would turn to
 every night when he wanted a drink of water didn't he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light? 6
  a dark bathroom can be pretty scary and he'd creep back to bed proud of himself thinking: tomorrow for sure i'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to dad
 he hadn't intended to make the promise
 it happened two weeks ago the night before his father left on a business trip to south america
 every piece of the nightmare was clear in place; and when he woke up his father was saying stop screaming quint
 he could remember the feel of his father's big hands the thump of his father's heart sending out signals- regular like radar 5
 let's talk about the beach
 while i'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig hear? 6
  look i can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck
 dr fortman says swimming would help your leg
 he says you're limping more than you need to 17
 how does he know? 10
  big dumb nut
 in the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out
 when you get back i'll probly be swimming better than victoria
 victoria was fourteen months younger than quint a head taller and could lick any boy or girl on the beach
 she called him stuck- up- that's why nobody plays with you mister stuck-up
 or what was worse she prayed for him out loud at bedtime: please lord gord please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised
 quint said now to the clouds
 strength began to zip up and down his chest
 he felt strong as a giant
 he unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg
 he wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks
 goolick goooolick creaked a sea gull
 aw shut up he said
 he stood on the rock a skinny dignified boy surrounded by the ocean
 the wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there bleeding wedged between the rocks and the waves
 i'm scared of the nightmare
 shivering he put on his clothes
 and shivering with shame he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water
 watch it big shot a hoarse voice yelled back
 she was holding on to his rock with one hand
 she wore a bathing suit like his mother's no straps on the shouders
 why didn't you duck? 12
  he snapped
 is
 she was sore as a boil
 ever hear of squatter's rights? 9
    sure
 they started with the kansas-nebraska bill of eighteen-   mister big britches aren't you? 7
    i'm mark gordon peters the fifth
 then why don't you stop squinting? 11
    i said quint
 quintus in latin means-   i can speak both kinds of latin smart aleck
 her cough sounded like cloth ripping
 you shouldn't smoke so much he said unconsciously imitating victoria's holier-than-thou voice
 she was horrified
 not having said hell before he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum
 sometimes eleven fourteen a day
 if i was your mama i'd wop your tail off
 my mother never wops me
 i've got this leg brace
 she seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace
 dingy-looking was what she said
 why don't you paint it red and white like a barber pole? 8
    because maybe i won't have to wear it always 7
 dr fortman says if i exercise my leg more maybe i can use a cane when i'm big
 she spouted a mouthful of water into the air
 someone's walking past you want to stop him zoooop snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane
 or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it- all you got to do is bannnnnng stooooomp your cane on the floor h 5
 hey will you look at that? 10
    maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail
 what kind? 25
    part collie part wire-haired terrier
 he always did when people asked
 holy mackerel that's the most unique dog i ever saw she said firmly
 his real name's dimaggio only we call him maggie because he has to take tranquilizers
 he's braver than he looks
 last tuesday he went on a ham jag
 a what? 17
    he would have told her but victoria was yodeling 17
 that meant mama wants you quint
 come home or i'll come find you
 even though this is my rock you can use it sometimes 10
 i come early in the morning
 see you around mister squint
 that was how they started being friends
 they met next morning and all the mornings thereafter 10
 same time early before the fog burned off because she didn't like the sun; it made her blister
 her name was sabella and the strip of seaweed around her neck was an emerald necklace the king gave her as a token of his undying love
 you going to marry the king? 15
  no
 he's got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork 7
 my hair is what he's nuts about
 naturally curly hair runs in my family
 personally i prefer straight hair like yours but as they say on the continent 'what can one do'? 5
  which continent? 15
  name one i been there
 japan she said smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks; then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup
 camels in tripoli had harelips
 near galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night
 as for dancing- holy mackerel he ought to see the gypsies in jerez; they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them
 she made better pictures than any book he'd read but he didn't say so
 artfully as the days went by he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the navy cross in the korean war; that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it; that he personally had an iq of 141 and was currently reading the mushr to ozon volume of the encyclopedia
 she skipped a piece of water at him and laughed a funny hoarse laugh he liked to hear
 nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as sabella 7
 get dressed up- the doctor's taking us out tonight 9
 and what encouraged by her giggles he imitated maggie who was crazy about ham
 he described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries cooling on the porch
 he snuck up on the ham like maggie gumming it with soft stumpy teeth then panting with thirst lapping up the water in the lagoon swelling up like a balloon staggering home to be sick while his mother said that does it
 that dog has to go
 say you're quite a comic sabella said admiringly
 ever thought about going on the stage? 10
    he hadn't
 but it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head 10
 either that or a veterinarian
 better make up your mind son sabella said
 you can't serve cod and salmon
 she said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward 11
 his encylopedia agreed with sabella
 next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the v-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around 6
 boy could she catch! like willie mays in the outfield 6
 nobody gave me flowers before
 her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough 7
 you can always tell a real gentleman- they got a certain je ne say quok
 sometimes they didn't talk at all
 he daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around 10
 once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answere d don't feel like it he was tempted to tell her about being scared 5
 but victoria began yodeling just then and he went home carrying sabella in the back of his head not thinking about her just knowing she was there smiling smelling of peppermints
 as for his promise- oh he had plenty of time buckets of time 9
 they were eating breakfast
 we beseech thee lord gord to bless this food- that was victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib 5
 same old breakfast till the phone rang making his mother's voice shake with excitement
 your daddy's in san francisco she told them
 he says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane 15
 fifteen days early- isn't that wonderful? 8
    yeah keen
 a cave seemed to be opening in quint's stomach
 children we'll have to get organized
 the baby can have an early nap
 victoria i want you to h   quint closed the screen door quietly so maggie wouldn't be scared
 hurry up we're late he said noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning the fog like a rope along the horizon the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and kool-aid green
 the cave in his stomach hurt
 he had to go into the water
 he'd tell sabella about the nightmare
 it had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung 11
 what caused it he didn't know
 the metal collar gagging his neck? 9
  sweating so much? 15
  the unbearable weight on his chest? 9
  all of it together meant drowning
 the first time the nurse took him out of the lung she said if he got frightened she'd put him back for a second
 when bobbie evans smashed up his car the jaguar his wife linda had given him for his last birthday and himself quite thoroughly with it driving back from an afternoon's golf at oakmont it seemed to mark the end of a long miswritten chapter in the social life of the community
 linda looked remote yet lovely in black and everyone held his or her breath
 not that linda was heartless not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than john cooper would 8
 hadn't linda been a perfect wife to bobbie who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years? 5
    wasn't john cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been twenty-five years earlier? 7
  and wasn't john's wife edythe even more appalling if possible? 8
  didn't john cooper after all this time deserve something better of life? 7
  wasn't it adult and realistic to look at it that way? 8
  and romantic? 25
    everybody knew that john cooper had married edythe on the rebound
 it was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life and it was a tribute to john's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his
 of course there was nothing you could do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen mousie chandler said to linda stuart
 poor john! linda accepted the reproach which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the allegheny mountains and john was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young men around pittsburgh
 for it had been john and linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the golf club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs
 john had claimed her from the stag line a young man a year out of dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes 7
 you saw them always together those years
 you talked about john-and-linda as an entity 15
 john-and-linda were at longue vue last night; john-and-linda drove to conneaut in three and a half hours
 then there was a spat over something as there had been lovers' spats before; only this one didn't heal
 you still said john-and-linda but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or dillinger 6
 it got worse instead of better
 first it came out after mr cooper's will was settled- he had died the year before- that john and his mother weren't rich any more 4
 and then there was linda's engagement to bobbie evans 15
 there was no connection between the two events because bobbie wasn't rich either though he was more aggressive than john 8
 he was a bright and handsome young man from new york who worked for the same steel company as john did
 some people said linda had just announced the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john came home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe his bride it could no longer be john-and-linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers
 it wasn't even john and edythe
 it was simply poor john
 there was nothing specifically wrong with edythe but there was absolutely nothing right about her either
 mousie chandler had been to school with her someplace near baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at horne's
 well you shouldn't underestimate edythe mousie said 12
 i know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained
 she is frivolous and scatterbrained but she really isn't shallowh
 bobbie and linda looked magnificent at their wedding 7
 john was at the church with edythe
 she giggled during the ceremony and mousie chandler who was one of linda's bridesmaids said john glared black as death at her 5
 as if he were choking she said
 poor john!   edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example
 her hair never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length
 she didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at longue vue but her bathing suits were far from smart
 and you didn't see her much at longue vue or anywhere for john had drifted away from the gang
 mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity 7
 others thought he couldn't stand seeing linda mrs bobbie evans still so beautiful so much in command of everything
 there were less-dramatic reasons too
 john's mother died not long after his marriage and there was even less cooper money left
 john sold the big old place in sewickley and bought a smaller house in fox chapel
 he was not reduced to poverty but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day 9
 john was good at his job
 it probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe to come home to
 though that may be unfair since ben cooper john's first son came along early in 1938 the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all cooper from fontanel to pink toes nary a trace of edythe 4
 but the continuing charm of the other children- sally in 1940 and jack in 1944- and all john's success at his work only made edythe's dizziness and general uselessness more glaring
 she never could fit into a crowd which had known which still knew and admired linda
 when there was bridge at edythe's house the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers 8
 she managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old mr webber the eldest elder who'd never donated more than five dollars to anything had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what edythe called the bosoms of the church
 john did find the missing checks and money afterward and the drive was actually oversubscribed which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries
 being an intelligent man john must have guessed what everyone thought about edythe but he never let on by so much as a brave smile 5
 poor john was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one 7
 he was an attentive and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people felt because they knew that money must be a problem to him 8
 but he got ahead in business: on leave from his job to an important washington assignment during the war; after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company
 the coopers saw bobbie and linda socially but no more than was necessary
 bobbie had been successful too though he didn't match john's pace and after all he didn't need to with all the stuart money 6
 he and linda settled down to being social leaders and linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year
 and then came the hairpin turn the smashed jaguar and linda mourning alone and lovely
 everyone held his or her breath
 don't think linda couldn't have got john back any time if she'd tried mousie gordon who had been mousie chandler said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le mont
 now you know she could've but she isn't that kind of girl 7
 but now- well it would be a blessing i think 13
 linda evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed bobbie's death could move her to feeling
 what she felt was a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome ambitious bobbie but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death
 she knew what people were thinking; it was what she had been thinking herself
 it was up to her to save poor john dear john to undo the wrong she had done but she trembled at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream
 there was no one who would blame her or john; she could be sure of that
 it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her to send her back to cleveland or anywhere
 and linda felt capable of capturing the affection of the children anxious even since she and bobbie had had none of their own 6
 it would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of
 linda would have to wait she knew
 but what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by? 11
  years of watching while poor john struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead 6
 of course he had done wonders h
 alloy steels and regular steels had different sales departments at smith + macisaacs where john and bobbie both worked 5
 bobbie had been head of the alloy division while john was just another good salesman in the regular branch
 so when old mr lovejoy the company president talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with carnegie-illinois it looked like the perfect chance for bobbie
 for linda knew how to help her husband not just the stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners for reuben lovejoy 8
 she was almost sick when bobbie came home with the news that poor john had won the job
 what did you do? 20
  she asked bobbie
 you must have done something something wrong 18
 lord knows i had everything set for you
 bobbie said something about damned pittsburghers sticking together and linda got angry at him
 they had their first real fight and bobbie went off to get drunk 8
 linda dragooned her uncle donald murkland into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened
 he was a director of s + m and must have been in on the decision 7
 but jolly old uncle donald would tell her no more than that bobbie had certainly been considered for the job but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand
 he didn't tell her of the long board meeting where bobbie and john were weighed one against the other
 i'm behind john cooper mr lovejoy said finally
 i think we' re agreed that he and evans are equal in ability so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive 7
 now i believe poor john'll work just a little harder 10
 with that wife of his i think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance
 bobbie with linda behind him will have plenty of other opportunities
 and also the money can't mean as much to bobbie 9
 bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it; poor john will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us
 most of the directors nodded
 uncle donald murkland found himself nodding agreement too 10
 after the surprise was over linda was almost as pleased as anyone with john's good luck though she agreed with bobbie's decision some months later to move to funk furnaces
 the job at funk wasn't particularly better but it got him away from being subordinate to john and assured him steady advancement since funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of linda's family
 poor john's rise continued to be meteoric
 when he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future 8
 she called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night 7
 shirley appreciated the chance to make some money 11
 such a nice little thing- lives right in the building 10
 that's swell i said sweetly
 i could get along without that three dollars 11
 in some ways it was worth being out the money- just knowing i was no longer obligated to nadine!   it was past midnight and we wer e in bed when the phone rang
 i stumbled through the hall wondering who would be calling at this hour
 i answered to find nadine at the other end 11
 you scared me half to death i said shakily
 what's wrong? 19
    janice nobody answers at the apartment! her voice came shrill 6
 i'm absolutely frantic! that stupid girl might have gone off and left francie!   oh she wouldn't do that i said
 she's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone 5
 but if you're worried you can go home and check- i can't leave the party! we're at ken thom's apartment and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat! old mr thom is already down on wally and we simply can't afford to get ken mad at us-   i was all set for what came next 6
 janice could you possibly go over and make sure everything's all right? 6
  i'll call you there in ten minutes- i can't make it in ten minutes- wondering as i said it why i should make it at all 5
 why should i go over at midnight to check on francie when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party? 6
  fifteen minutes then! please janice
 i'll be glad to pay you-    so sure that money could do anything! all right i said
 not for the dollar or so nadine would give me 11
 but because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment and if i didn't go over who would? 7
  chris was sound asleep and i didn't see any sense in waking him
 i dressed in the kitchen then left a note on the table telling him what had happened
 i drove off through the cool darkness to nadine's apartment and rang the bell and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door 8
 her face was flushed from sleep
 it's all right i said as she started to look scared 7
 mrs roberts had called and couldn't wake you
 i just came over to make sure everything was all right 11
 i'm- hard to wake up she faltered
 she didn't look over thirteen
 and nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable! i have to get up early for church tomorrow she went on
 i didn't know it was going to be this late!   the phone started ringing
 that's mrs roberts again i said
 i crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone
 i told nadine everything was fine and that i'd be getting on home
 janice would you mind staying? 10
  there was a ragged edge to her voice now as if she'd been crying
 wally's drunk- i'll get him out of here as soon as i possibly can but i don't want shirley to see him like this
 you know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building-   not a word of thanks for what i'd already done 7
 the receiver clicked in my ear
 she didn't even give me a chance to refuse
 well there wasn't any law that said i had to stay! but then i looked at shirley and thought that i might as well- the child needed her sleep and heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be with wally coming home drunk
 so i told her mrs roberts would pay her in the morning and she scooted off to her own apartment
 after i looked in at francie i went into the living room and waited
 i must have dozed off because i came to with a start at the sound of voices
 nadine's shrill with anger- wally's loud and thick- as i went to the door i heard the clock strike two
 i opened the door and wally stumbled in- fast- as if nadine had pushed him
 i had always thought she was so beautiful
 but now she looked ugly
 her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out and if looks could kill wally would have been dead
 pack your clothes she hissed
 pack- and get out!   you're crazy wally said thickly 8
 he lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it and was instantly asleep
 nadine strode over to him and her pointed nails raked across his face
 i grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second i thought that maybe wally was right and she was crazy
 you stay out of this she spat at me
 he's ruined us- do you hear me- he's ruined us! he insulted ken thom! her eyes were wild
 he told ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman! and the other people there were listening! we're ruined and he's going to get out if i have to throw him down the stairs- you'd better simmer down i said nervously
 in the state she was in she could actually kill him! now you just take it easy and i'll make you some tea-   tea nadine screeched 7
 how can you be so damn stupid? 17
  wally's lost his job! ken will never forgive him- never! and we don't have any money- we don't have a dime! all we own is francie's bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even o we on them
 and we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours- and all because of that-   i clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth
 stop that! you'll wake up the whole building
 wally can't go any place at this hour- well then i'll get out- but she looked uncertain
 she was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning
 you go to bed i said curtly
 in the morning you and wally can talk things out-   she collapsed against me as if everything inside her snapped
 i got her into bed and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out
 it was three o'clock before i figured it was all right to go 9
 i left her a limp bundle of self-pity shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her
 wally was snoring on the davenport
 i had done all i could
 i had done all i was going to do
 whether or not wally lost his job was no concern of mine 10
 i drove home found chris still asleep
 i snuggled up close to him- loving him- thankful for a man like him
 i kept on being thankful
 in the afternoon nadine a nd wally came over with francie 14
 wally sat in our big chair his hands between his knees looking ready to cry
 i'd had all this trouble with the old man that's why i drank so much
 i- got fired yesterday for not attending to business-   old mr thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job wally confessed and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired
 seems that the kid wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side
 mr thom had gotten wally on the phone and fired him 7
 i thought i'd smooth things over through ken wally said miserably 10
 but ken got coy and wouldn't make any promises 9
 and i was plastered and i blew my stack- and told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman! i tried to quiet nadine because the children were there
 but she was beyond caring what she said
 things may smooth over yet chris said his nice lean face grave with honest concern
 but i couldn't help thinking that nadine and wally were getting just what they deserved
 now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough 10
 when a bubble breaks there's nothing
 little by little during the week chris and i discovered the crazy unbelievable way nadine and wally had lived
 they had not only spent every cent- they were in debt up to their necks owing on everything they owned
 on top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent and the day wally received written notice that he was fired they were evicted
 worst of all wally had no training for any kind of work 6
 he had fallen into a soft job and now the job was gone and he was stranded
 i wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over
 i said i wished we were too
 it was easy enough to say it because of course we couldn't spare a cent
 but chris brightened up like a candle
 i'm glad you feel that way honey
 there is one big way we can help them
 we can let them move in with us-   something i had simply never thought of
 something so incredible-   i just stared at him
 it was incredible- he gave me an embarrassed pleading look 11
 i know we'd be pretty crowded
 but it would only be for a couple of weeks- until they get straightened out
 straightened out- they'd had years of making all that money! i won't do it i said flatly
 nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this! well now she can sleep in the street for all i care! that isn't like you janice chris said uncomfortably
 then i felt uncomfortable too
 i didn't want to be like that mean and bitter
 but darn it all why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us? 8
    but in the end we did
 it just seemed as if there was nothing else to do 12
 the finance company took all their furniture- and they didn't have a cent to their name
 to my way of thinking he was scared sick
 his luck had failed him and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world
 chris made trip after trip in our old car moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries nadine had bought on special 6
 at least we'll eat i thought grimly as i put all the food away 7
 while i worked nadine sat and cried
 when she wasn't crying she was in our bedroom fighting with wally 8
 virus infection nothing she'd scream at him 10
 you're too lazy to go out and look for another job 7
 you're just a no-good bum!   it was a mess all right 7
 but it couldn't go on forever- a couple of weeks chris had said 10
 i figured i could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks
 but the two weeks dragged into three and they were still with us
 nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten wally out of bed 8
 he set out every morning looking for work and come home around noon full of alibis and excuses
 wendell thom had black-balled him
 nobody would even take his application
 you can get something nadine would snap
 you can get a job working in a grocery store if nothing else 11
 the high school kids have got everything sewed up he said a whine in his voice
 those damn punks- taking work away from men who need it 7
 by fall they'll be back in school i'd say trying to sound encouraging
 but this was only the middle of july h
 and i couldn't take six more weeks of this
 i mentioned it to chris one stifling hot night when i had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air
 i don't really believe in intuition
 but i swear to you from the moment i opened my eyes i knew it was going to be a bad day
 part of it was the weather so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital
 part of it was being so tired- i'd not only had my usual full day yesterday but a dinner meeting as well that kept me up late 8
 but the rest of it the main part wasn't based on logic at all 13
 it was just going to be one of those days
 for the thousandth time i wished i'd chosen some nice nine- to-five five-days-a-week profession
 and for the thousandth time i answered myself 13
 i hadn't chosen medicine- it had chosen me
 actually i shouldn't complain i told myself in the shaving mirror
 i had a lot to be thankful for
 a profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at
 maybe i didn't see as much of gladdy as i'd like but how much worse it would have been if i'd had to board her out somewhere after alice went- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home 5
 at least we were together and we had mrs hodges bless her to look after us- no mother could be fonder of gladdy than mrs hodges was 5
 i was lucky in lots of ways no doubt about it
 especially in the way gladdy had turned out
 growing up without a mother from the time she was three- it wasn't a good thing for a child even knowing the kind of mother alice had been
 but i mustn't start on alice
 she is a closed book a picture i keep on my bureau but never look at
 if she'd kept on as she'd been going the story i'd told gladdy would probably have been true by now anyhow h   as usual gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table 5
 her first class wasn't until ten but she always got up to have breakfast with me
 it made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided all on her own to go to college right here in town made me feel good too 7
 oh i knew that i couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision
 i had a feeling that young pete michelson the most promising intern at fairview had something to do with it too 8
 she'd been out with pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little
 but once i was alone again driving to the hospital the heaviness returned
 if she and pete were really getting serious i'd have to do some hard thinking
 should i tell him the truth about alice? 7
  did he have a right to know the secret i'd kept from gladdy all these years? 9
    the boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when i got to fairview
 two interns and dick ishii the other resident
 i'm chief of medicine here and this morning would start like all others with me taking the boys on the rounds
 pete was down on seven dick told me and he'd meet us there 7
 there wasn't anything of special interest that morning no one sicker than they should have been
 pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on seven- he'd had a case of post-operative shock but it was all taken care of now
 seven is a women's floor and as it happened not very busy right then
 when we'd finished our regular rounds pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor
 got a new one in last night he said
 i haven't seen her yet but i hear she's a lulu!   i wasn't surprised
 the ward was a small one four beds kept reserved for female alcoholics
 we didn't get many at fairview and they were never pretty sights 10
 it was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward
 the moment i walked in the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed
 they'd cleaned her up some of course and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk
 but there was something about her- and i felt my lips forming a name
 alice h but this woman's name was rose bancroft! i looked at the chart for reassurance
 yes rose bancroft diagnosis: acute alcoholism 13
 she looked about sixty though i recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four
 an ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry
 her coarse hair was two-colored- bleached blonde and its real dirty gray
 oh could it be? 13
  no no h it was an unfortunate resemblance that was all it was and i turned to dick forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind
 in a low voice dick filled us in h she'd been picked up downtown passed out in the doorway
 although quiet when they brought her in she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out
 it was the old story
 we'd keep her a day or two and the aa people would talk to her 5
 but if she wasn't interested she'd just go back to the same life she'd left
 turning toward the patient again i- i can't describe what happened to me then except to say that i felt sick
 i tell you it took every ounce of control i had to be able to speak
 now miss- or is it mrs bancroft? 9
  i never liked going straight into an examination with patients- it relaxes them i've always thought to chat first 6
 this was one time i'd have gladly broken my own rule but habit was too strong
 hey! her voice was flat and dull
 but those penetrating eyes- i had to turn my head away 10
 it was then that i saw what the drawn-back covers revealed 15
 there were bloodspots on the sheet
 your period? 18
    she shook her head
 i been spotting a little now and then she said quietly no emotion in her voice
 have you spoken to a doctor about it? 12
    once again there was a negative shake
 i told miss groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table
 better do a papanicolaou i told pete
 it was only a few moments before miss groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal but i couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination
 pete stood by with a slide and took the smear sent it down to the lab with a request for the test
 that done i told miss groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind
 i was busy the rest of the day
 late in the afternoon i was up on seven again 8
 one of my private patients was being admitted and i went in to see her settled
 on my way to the elevator i ran into pete
 i've got the results on the bancroft smear test he said 5
 there's something there all right
 do you want to talk to her doctor? 25
    well- i didn't- i didn't ever want to see that woman again 7
 but that was ridiculous of course
 we'll do a d and c and get her permission for a hysterectomy 4
 maybe it's nothing maybe it's intraepithelial or in situ- can't take any chances
 if you can keep her here that long pete said wryly 12
 groggins tells me she's started badgering already wants to get out
 wants to get to her booze i guess
 well better see what i can do
 we'd been standing right outside miss bancroft's door and as i went to turn the knob to enter i was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar
 but she seemed to be dozing and in any case we'd been talking in low tones
 her eyes opened as soon as she heard me though and once again i felt an inward shiver
 i sure can't complain about the service in this place she said 9
 i just got through seeing one of you guys
 what do you want? 32
  there was something almost insulting in her tone but i disregarded it
 i've just been talking to dr michelson i said
 we'd like you to have a dilatation and curettage
 that's quite minor nothing to worry about
 but we would like your permission to do- that is to go further if it proves necessary
 suppose you let me explain
 actually i rather doubt that we'll have to do this 9
 even if we do you'll be out of here in a week probably 15
 i was sure that was the difficulty- she just didn't want to stay here where she couldn't get to the liquor
 i looked at her in amazement
 i'd had patients who'd refused surgery before of course but never one who didn't show in one way or another the reason why 4
 mostly it was fear but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the coverlet
 will you tell me why? 11
  i asked
 she smiled a smile without humor
 you shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door she said
 i've got cancer haven't i? 4
  she went on disregarding my protests
 i'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs 7
 let your pupils learn on someone else doctor 12
 just let me die in peace
 i stared at her almost speechless
 her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person i thought she was
 even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone 9
 this was someone who'd come down in the world i thought 9
 a long long way down
 again there was something familiar about her something h   you haven't got cancer i said as strongly as i could
 i don't know what you heard that would make you think so but i assure you i don't even know myself so how can you be so sure? 5
  and even if-   don't give me a lot of talk joe 9
 she could have found out my first name of course- that wouldn't be difficult
 but there was that something some echo in the way she spoke h   she was watching me intently a funny little half-smile on her lips 6
 surprised baby? 19
  guess i've changed haven't i? 8
  but you haven't changed much joe
 i knew then knew with a heart-stopping shock 11
 alice- i stammered through dry lips
 alice for goodness sake-   alice she echoed mockingly 7
 what's the matter joe you scared of me? 9
  think i'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife? 6
  well don't worry
 just let me outta here-   but why did you come back? 6
  i'd found my voice
 where have you been all these years? 8
  she shrugged
 as for coming back here- well i'll tell you the truth i didn't even know where i was when i came to
 the last thing i remember is a bar in san diego- the way she spoke her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout made me shudder 7
 and this was gladdy's mother!   i never asked you for any favors joe she went on but i'm asking one now
 let me outta here! you doctors are all alike- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good? 7
  no i want out joe!   i looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me
 let her out let her out- that would be the solution wouldn't it? 11
  what she'd said was true- in all these years she'd never asked for anything from me
 if i let her go she'd disappear once more
 and gladdy would be safe! i was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea
 her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's; the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air i breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic
 yielding-mediterranean-woman-flesh- of-water she soothed me and drew me deeper into her
 i no longer knew how deep i was somewhere under 230 feet getting drunker happier and more contented by the second 7
 the reasons for this dive seemed foolish now
 only the dive itself had any meaning
 the metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if i should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water
 perhaps if i took off the aqua-lung i could swim better love my woman better
 i chuckled aloud and the mouthpiece fell out
 while a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down a clear part sorted over recent events among them my only positive act in a long time
 it was when i packed up what duds i had and went to paris 10
 it was no vacation just me getting out after a bellyfull 14
 i knew it wouldn't be the same
 wild kicks never are but i hoped to dig up a better frame of mind 7
 once before i had been to paris long before i married valery 7
 that first time was good and it stuck with me 10
 i was twenty-one back then in the army and fog put our plane down at orly instead of rhine-main
 it was a saturday evening in april with a mist-like rain and i was a little high on the good taste of life
 i had a pocketful of money which was unusual when i was in the army and the plane would be grounded all night
 in less than an hour i had gotten a hotel showered shaved and was out on the champs elysees in a fresh uniform
 i felt like a hun in rome
 all the women were beautiful and the men were equal to them; everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes
 there were some sweet machines other than women: an old bugatti a lean farina coachwork on an american chassis a swallow a type 540- k mercedes and lots more
 there was the arc de triomphe and the tour d'eiffel- i was no yokel but i was young and this was paris!   i had champagne at maxim's then went into a cafe called the jour et nuit to ask the way to montmartre
 i met claire which was better
 she was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could and washing it down with red wine
 i didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful 5
 she was blonde and young and nice and round in a tight white dress
 maybe her ravenous eating wasn't grotesque because she was so positive about it
 when she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill she came directly to my table and said:   handsome soldier i have assuaged one hunger with food
 i feel another of terrible urgency
 is your evening free? 24
    madame i said with noblesse oblige because of the handsome- yeah
 and so off we went to her apartment
 she was a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl 11
 toward the break of day i waxed philosophical and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese
 now it was nine years later and it wasn't spring but winter when i returned
 i got there on a saturday evening
 i made the mistake of going to the jour et nuit 9
 the place was busy but i didn't feel like a hun
 i sat waiting for life to come along and sweep me up 6
 i had part of a bottle of french beer called panther pils then switched to tuborg
 after a few hours life hadn't showed and i was crocked 11
 i went to my hotel and slept
 the next morning a little cognac made me feel better- but what can you do in paris on sunday morning? 6
  so i drank more cognac
 all that day and monday i drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space
 i read the tropic of capricorn and the tropic of cancer 10
 that's what was on my mind
 i was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when i dozed off 12
 i felt better tuesday evening when i woke up
 my head was clear my thinking sober and i was reconciled to this paris idea as a flop on top of all my others
 a good binge has that kind of therapeutic value 8
 sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing
 i went out into it
 i walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until i found a park and i sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky
 there was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night
 i had on only a topcoat but i wasn't cold
 pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick
 she saw me and sat down beside me three feet away 9
 suddenly i understood why she had the umbrella 8
 it gave her poise and posture
 without it she would have been drab and limp
 it gave her the right to sit down beside me back straight one hand out on the handle
 i couldn't imagine her without it
 i knew all about her
 she was another human being and happened to be a hustler 10
 i didn't much care if she were there or not
 after a while she said with sort of an unuttered laugh you have snow in your hair and ears
 hardly glancing at her i smiled a ble ak one which said thanks baby but i'd rather be alone
 she was silent for a while then said why are you so unhappy? 6
  i'm not unhappy i lied staring at the snow
 she was trying to make a hole in my armor and i didn't want it 6
 is it a woman? 25
  she asked gently
 she must have seen the ring on my left hand 12
 well- women and unhappiness go together i observed profoundly adding you can wager your derriere on that
 ah monsieur it is not my business to wager it h   this took me so funny i had to look at her
 i felt my frozen sad face crumble and i grinned a silly one i couldn't have helped
 i even snorted a chuckle
 she smiled at me but it was an awfully sad smile 7
 she was even more miserable than me
 her eyes were smiling too but so sadly and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them
 now isn't it better to smile? 12
  she asked
 because i liked this sad person so much i said will you have a drink with me? 8
    i could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes and i wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit 6
 anyway i pulled a bottle of remy martin out of my topcoat drew the cork and passed it to her
 i could see she was shocked
 i'm sorry i haven't got a glass i said
 non non she said taking the bottle not for that be sorry 6
 she tilted up and drank and then i drank 10
 it's really rotten to drink good cognac like that but i hadn't cared before
 i wasn't going to lug around a glass
 there wasn't much light in the blue dark but i could see her well
 no child this tart she must have been thirty-five or even forty 10
 somehow she was attractive
 not good looking but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive
 i liked her and all at once i was glad she was there 7
 we finished the bottle- i hadn't had a lot out of it earlier- not speaking much to each other and we stayed sober
 i suppose we were cold but we didn't feel it
 we seemed to be drowsing sadly soberly in the cold cold air while the snow fell
 then she said allons and we got up and went to my hotel without another word
 i sensed no stranger in her
 we undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance i had once known with valery
 i decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age 12
 she had a funny little scar on her stomach on the left side 9
 i think we were very tired for we awoke at the same moment deeply rested surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows which were wet where the rime had melted
 i felt wonderful the absolute opposite of last night's melancholy 8
 i was hungry as a wolf and my body felt lean and vital 10
 bon jour i said brightly sitting up which pulled the covers to her hips
 she looked good with her short tousled hair and no make-up 9
 maybe closer to thirty i thought
 bon jour! she exclaimed smiling
 j'ai faim! yeah but breakfast first
 with a laugh she beat me to the bathroom 14
 i called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her 8
 she came out pink from a hot bath and i gave her my robe 8
 i had brushed my teeth showered shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast
 the toothbrush monsieur he said presenting it 12
 i gave it to the woman
 what is this for? 28
  she asked innocently
 why to brush your teeth
 but i already have! i used yours
 oh? 19
  i said with round eyes
 i wondered if i ought to go use the new one myself 11
 but i smelled the coffee and thinking what the hell live dangerously i decided i would scald my worries away
 the coffee wasn't very hot though made in a filter pot but it was good
 we sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham hot hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread
 as we ate we talked
 her name was suzanne and mine stephen
 we sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee 9
 you are very tactful do you know stephen she remarked 10
 yes because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush 9
 i raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror 10
 i didn't really use yours she went on
 i carry one in my purse
 i know men never kiss les putains
 to my immense relief she changed the subject in the next sentence: shall we go to the louvre today? 6
    all right
 i said with enthusiasm at the idea
 i put aside my empty cup
 she smiled all the way to her wise sad eyes and drained her own 9
 what is this from? 28
  i asked touching the scar on her stomach
 it was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle 13
 the cynicism was back in her eyes a bitter wisdom and i wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all
 she understood sex anyway and played at it well 10
 we went to the louvre for a few hours then by metro to a cabaret in montmartre
 it was a nice place not filled with smoke 13
 we had champagne and steamed mussels
 the sommelier brought the wine first a magnum instead of the bottle i had ordered
 he must have thought i was a tourist
 i fixed him with a steely eye and said what's this for? 9
  i didn't ask for a jeroboam of champagne
 i thought that was pretty humorous but i didn't laugh 11
 two letters had arrived for miss theresa stubblefield: she put them in her bag
 she would not stop to read them in american express as many were doing sitting on benches or leaning against the walls but pushed her way out into the street
 this was her first day in rome and it was june
 an enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead 10
 in her mind's eye- her imagination responding fully almost exhaustingly to these shores' peculiar powers of stimulation- she saw the city as from above telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked aqueducts and tombs here a cypress there a pine and all around the low blue hills
 pictures in old latin books returned to her: the appian way today the colosseum the arch of constantine
 she would see them looking just as they had in the books and this would make up a part of her delight
 moreover nursing various stubblefields- her aunt then her mother then her father- through their lengthy illnesses theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot
 england france germany switzerland and italy had all been rendered for her time and again and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight to see all these places with her own eyes
 the very night after her father's funeral she had thought though never admitted to a soul: now i can go
 there's nothing to stop me now
 so here it was here was italy anyway and terribly noisy 9
 in the street the traffic was really frightening
 cars taxis buses and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain 6
 shoals of tourists went by her in national groups- english school girls in blue uniforms german boys with cameras attached smartly dressed americans looking in shop windows
 glad to be alone theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left
 something special was going on here just now- the annual display of azalea plants
 she had heard about it the night before at her hotel 12
 it was not yet complete: workmen were unloading the potted plants from a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above 7
 the azaleas were as large as shrubs and their myriad blooms many still tight in the bud ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink along with many white ones too 6
 marvelous thought theresa climbing in her portly well-bred way for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything
 in rome all over europe she intended to move very slowly indeed 9
 halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down 6
 other people were doing it too sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above watching the azaleas mass or just enjoying the sun
 theresa sat with her letters in her lap breathing mediterranean air
 the sun warmed her as it seemed to be warming everything perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches 8
 she loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette 7
 content h excited; how could you be both at once? 7
  strange but she was
 presently she picked up the first of the letters 17
 a few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay
 of course one of them would have to go and do this! poor cousin elec she thought tears rising to sting in the sun but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer? 7
  and how on earth did i ever get this letter anyway? 8
  she had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her
 her cousin emma carraway had written it in her loose high old lady's script- t's carefully crossed but l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope
 cousin emma had simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy on the envelope had walked up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor
 somebody had scrawled american express piazza di spagna? 7
  across the envelope and now theresa had it all as easily as if she had been the president of the republic or the pope 7
 inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness death and burial of cousin alexander carraway
 cousin emma and cousin elec brother and sister- unmarried devoted aging- had lived next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time immemorial until the stubblefields had moved to montgomery fifteen years ago
 two days before he was taken sick cousin elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas and cousin elec h ad always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother- of-pearl paper knife which theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died
 i'm supposed to care as much now as then as much here as there she realized with a sigh
 this letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put rome italy on it
 she refolded the letter replaced it in its envelope and turned with relief to one from her brother george
 but alas george when he had written had only just returned from going to tuxapoka to cousin elec's funeral
 he was full of heavy family reminiscence
 all the fine old stock was dying out look at the world today 9
 his own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and theresa had always taken for granted and as for his grandchildren he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all
 a life of gentility and principle such as cousin elec had lived had to be known at first hand h
 poor george! the only boy the family darling
 together with her mother both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong
 theresa had seen him through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls safely married to the right sort however much in the early years of that match his wife anne had not seemed to understand poor george
 could it just be theresa wondered that anne had understood only too well and that george all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull? 6
    as for cousin alexander carraway the only thing theresa could remember at the moment about him was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at cousin emma's call- first papa then mother then theresa and george 6
 there they all did their uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of his foot
 he had hobbled downstairs into the parlor in his agony and was sitting wrapped in his bathrobe on a footstool
 he held his long clenched foot in both hands and this and his contorted face- he was trying heroically not to cry out- made him look like a large skinny old monkey
 they all surrounded him the family circle theresa and george as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens and cousin emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan
 can you think of anything to do? 11
  she kept repeating
 i hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up i'll just have to! can you think of anything to do? 6
  you might treat it like the hiccups said papa 8
 drop a cold key down his back
 i just hope this happens to you someday said cousin elec who was not at his best
 poor cousin elec george said
 he was younger than theresa: she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused
 now here they both were still the same george full of round-eyed woe and cousin emma in despair
 theresa shifted to a new page
 of course there are practical problems to be considered 9
 cousin emma is alone in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it
 robbie and beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them and anne and i have told her she's more than welcome here but i think she feels that she might be an imposition especially as long as our rosie is still in high school
 the other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that tuxapoka is populated with- miss edna whittaker for example
 but there is more in this than meets the eye
 a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in 11
 the wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off h
 i hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them
 i may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best h 6
 i really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day thought theresa it always makes me sick
 i'll start sneezing in a minute sitting on these cold steps 6
 she got up standing uncertainly for a moment then moving aside to let go past her talking a group of young men
 they wore shoes with pointed toes odd to american eyes and narrow trousers and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick 5
 yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome and felt themselves to be so
 just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos parker fountain pens rosaries papal portraits
 no no! she said
 the man did not wish to leave
 he knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them
 carrozza rides in the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialized h
 theresa turned away to escape and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two
 there she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed american lady carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag ascending the steps alone
 was he ever successful theresa wondered
 the lady with the alligator bag registered interest doubt then indignation; at last alarm
 she cast about as though looking for a policeman: this really shouldn't be allowed! finally she scurried away up the steps 7
 theresa stubblefield still holding the family letters in one hand realized that her whole trip to europe was viewed in famil y circles as an interlude between cousin elec's death and doing something about cousin emma
 they were even anne and george probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out one or two countries and come home in august to get cousin emma's house ready before the teachers came to tuxapoka in september
 of course it wasn't anne and george's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't know what they would do without theresa? 5
  the trouble is theresa thought that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely nothing here is supposed even to exist
 they would not care if all of europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow
 it never registered with them that i had time to real all of balzac dickens and stendhal while papa was dying not to mention everything in the city library after mother's operation 7
 it would have been exactly the same to them if i had read through all twenty-six volumes of elsie dinsmore
 she arranged the letters carefully one on top of the other 11
 then with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself she tore them in two
 signora? 19
  she became aware that two italian workmen carrying a large azalea pot were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display
 mi diapiace signora ma h insomma h
 oh h put it there! she indicated a spot a little distance away 6
 i knew it as surely as everybody in westfield- that lucille was a husband stealer
 you can't keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus
 and i've been told that just abo ut every town no matter what its size has its lucille warren
 just as it has its susan dolan though nobody'd ever bothered to tell me that
 they even talked about lucille down at the young christians' league where i spent a lot of time in bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission
 i never heard my folks talk about her though
 they were good-living religious people and i can truthfully say i never heard them spread any gossip about anybody 8
 even if they ever did say anything about people like lucille warren i know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me 7
 my folks and my faith protected me from things like that 8
 and so i was really upset the first time i discovered that my boy friend johnnie was seeing mrs warren
 i asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck
 i asked him if it was true
 he gave me a straight honest answer
 look sue baby he'd said
 much as i love you- well a guy's a guy and lucille's willing to- to come across
 honest kitten that's all it is- i don't even like lucille much
 i guess it was at that moment that i realized what i was up against in the person of lucille warren
 but it didn't seem fair
 my love for johnnie was young and clean- how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who didn't hesitate to use her sex 6
 johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line
 it was a vivid sharp february morning that johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard bringing some stuff dad had ordered 9
 i wasn't in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men but the moment i saw johnnie i knew he was different
 he wasn't only different- he was it
 he had an easy masculine grace about him the kind that kids don't have but that i had sometimes admired in other older men 6
 his smile was quick and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp
 the most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me too
 i could hardly believe such good luck was mine 13
 and now lucille warren had gotten a look at him 9
 i guess she was between affairs or something but anyway she had set her sights on johnnie my johnnie
 i didn't like it one bit
 but what could i do? 22
  a man had to have his release- at least that's what the boys used to say in high school- and i wasn't providing it for johnnie 6
 she wouldn't have even if he'd asked her
 but he wouldn't ask her- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will
 and he wouldn't leave her either- he'd told me that 12
 he was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy
 johnnie loved me and wanted me
 but the only love i was giving him was the pure kind 9
 it was weeks before we even kissed for the first time 15
 against my folks' wishes we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck
 the rides were tame enough- mostly we talked 10
 but by the time the first crackling of spring came around we both knew we were hopelessly in love
 yet even then we did nothing much but talk and maybe neck a little
 it's so crazy i told him once
 i always imagined i would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that
 and you fall for a lumber jockey
 who drinks far too much
 and i was ticking off the items on my fingers swears too much and goes out with the boys whoever they are too much and who never goes to church and won't even listen when i try to persuade him to come back to the fold
 he examined his nails carefully
 i could walk out the door
 and never show my face or my truck around here again 9
 he still wasn't looking at me
 or i could visit lucille warren
 he shrugged noncommittally
 and now he was seeing her
 he'd just admitted it to me
 i huddled miserably beside him in the truck 15
 it was all my doing- his seeing her
 johnnie and i had been innocent in our love and that was the way i wanted to keep it
 at first johnnie hadn't understood- how could he not being a religious person like me? 7
  but then he had said all right kid if that's how you want it that's how it'll be
 but what had i done trying to keep us pure? 10
  i had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman 8
 i had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the devil!   so one week later i surrendered to him in the little motel on route 10
 i was desperate to hold him to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed and to keep him from the clutches of lucille warren 8
 and though at the time i blushed to admit it even to myself there was in me a growing desire a sexual awareness that johnnie had set in motion an awareness that no other man had ever triggered 5
 i wanted him with a terrifying fierceness
 astonishingly enough it was my own voice i heard there in the darkness begging this man to make love to me
 i will kitten!   outside in the summertime fields behind the motel a thousand crickets serenaded us
 will you always love me this way? 7
    uh huh
 and i snuggled closer to the man l loved
 it was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced
 i had had no wedding ceremony no witnesses no certificate of marriage but i had all the joy that goes with them 7
 johnnie h? 19
    it can't be wrong can it? 12
  not really
 johnnie rose on one elbow
 it's never wrong if love is real
 i took great comfort from his words and smiled to myself in the darkness
 idiot's delight i later discovered
 i felt no conflict between what i was doing and my strict religious upbringing
 i had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids and many times i had thought about my love for johnnie who being thirty brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about
 i had also thought a lot about how god must look on true love and so in a way i was keeping my promise to god my promise to remain pure until i was married
 i was practically a bride after all
 there would have been a ceremony if it had been possible 15
 of this i had no doubt
 wouldn't johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness? 5
  of course he would
 he'd not only told me so he'd proved it
 it wasn't johnnie's fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable 8
 just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children as any decent man would that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too 5
 and if i could contribute to that i'd do it
 no price is too high when true love is at stake
 and i had no doubts about how true this love was 12
 i'd never even petted with a boy and after i met johnnie he never touched me for the longest while not until i all but threw myself at him
 he was plenty attentive all right but he behaved like a gentleman and i figured that emotionally i was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half
 what could a mere twelve years matter? 10
  it wasn't i was sure a difference in age that came between people but a difference in maturity
 and hadn't i rescued him from lucille warren? 9
  she'd have gotten him if i hadn't stopped her
 after all lucille warren was a husband-stealer from way back 9
 but i'd been a good girl and now god was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared 8
 it was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring
 always and always johnnie? 11
    always
 convention time in boston
 a chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow 8
 from the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming members of the young christians' league and i'd been chosen to represent our chapter
 i had mixed emotions about going
 i'd been seeing johnnie almost a year now but i still didn't want to leave him for five whole days
 but i had looked forward so much to being with this church group
 i hadn't been doing as much work as i used to in westfield and i felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever 7
 i wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group
 so i went to boston
 the first meeting was held in faneuil hall a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states
 my cousin alma at whose home i was staying during the convention introduced me to a group of young people from rhode island
 one of them was a very friendly lovely fellow named ronald a boy about my age with slick blond hair and dancing blue eyes 8
 he looked very different from johnnie- in fact he looked sort of like me
 i thought so and he mentioned it and alma said so too 8
 after the meeting there was going to be a party at someone's house
 i assumed alma would get me there but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up we were separated
 outside the hall i anxiously looked around for her then all at once there was a hand on my elbow
 hey there beautiful twin of mine ronald said
 need a pumpkin to get to the party? 13
    i couldn't help laughing with him
 well i should find alma- i began
 by the time we arrived the party was already going strong 10
 a couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and i realized they were drinking
 my folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house so my first taste of it had been- of course- with johnnie
 i hadn't liked it at first- it was bitter and burning 9
 but when johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale i enjoyed it
 of course i enjoyed 'most anything if i did it with johnnie 11
 johnnie h i suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening
 but that was only natural i decided; surely he was still resting snugly in my heart
 i don't see alma anywhere i said
 c'mon let's find out where they're keeping the glasses 8
 i- i don't think so ronald
 aw come on
 but at least come along while i get lubricated
 strange faces most of them and i wasn't even sure all of them had come from the league meeting
 under normal circumstances he had a certain bright-eyed all-american-boy charm with great appeal for young ladies old ladies and dogs
 today he looked like an astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space: hollow eyes hollow cheeks hollow stomach
 a shot of orange juice would make everything seem better 7
 he looked around his little eden: bureau bed table chair two-burner stove
 you share a refrigerator mrs kirby had said and somehow at midnight after the long drive from new york in pelting ra in that had sounded reasonable
 in the cold light of day it seemed a lunatic arrangement 14
 share bath maybe- but share refrigerator? 7
  she had explained it- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units
 and where was the thing? 12
  he remembered seeing it last night when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables
 ah yes- his half of a refrigerator stood outside on the curving veranda between unit number three and unit number four
 it was still raining and mrs kirby's cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore vivid blue and green and magenta 9
 charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long skinny green pills his spirits as damp as the day
 this vacation had seemed like a good idea last week when his doctor had prescribed it
 take a full month the doctor had said
 lots of sun lots of rest
 the red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound
 this is a sleeping capsule
 the others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked
 you young men get to be my age you won't take flu so lightly 9
 charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment 7
 the doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi; but charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew too that there was no pill to cure it
 he had loved and lost vivian wayne to somebody else had watched her marry the somebody else and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever which was really piling it on 5
 he had caught too like an ailment a confirmed distrust of women
 once burned- scalded really because vivian had given him every encouragement- forever shy
 from now on his was going to be a man's world: the north woods duck blinds at dawning beer and poker and male secretaries 8
 meanwhile he had this miserable cold and as he leaned against the refrigerator watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet the doctor's prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery 5
 in these damp circumstances he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia
 he looked up to see mrs kirby awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker bearing down on him
 three-day blow! she bellowed triumphantly 11
 he had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of pyhrric victory over the tourists
 fine day after tomorrow she added
 i hope so he said
 thought i'd bake it out in the sun
 you've got a peaked look
 better get in out of the wet
 charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal peony being less than weatherproof
 as for its being fine day after tomorrow he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again with vivian lost to him forever
 he could imagine her at this minute honeymooning in nassau with what's-his-name lounging on golden sands looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss
 all charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon a salami sandwich for lunch and a lonely old age- if he lived that long 6
 he leafed through the light reading provided by mrs kirby for her guests: four separate adventures of the bobbsey twins and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle hideously illustrated
 he dozed only to dream of vivian and woke only to crash into the night table bruising his other shin
 he took a yellow pill only to choke on it and went for the salami only to find something alive in the refrigerator- something pink and fuzzy
 his first thought was that mrs kirby in her mania for color had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in; but on further investigation the thing proved to be a sweater of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets- pale pale pink and according to the label size thirty-four
 he thought about it for a minute could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator got the salami bread and a bermuda onion and put the whole thing out of his mind
 next morning he found a note in the refrigerator
 would you mind wrapping your onion? 11
  said this note
 the smell permeates everything! everything being the sweater a lipstick case and a squirt bottle of kissin' kare pink hand lotion 5
 the note paper was pink too and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine
 not that he had supposed considering the evidence that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the beach patrol 9
 he scrawled sorry across the bottom of the note and then against his better judgment added: don't you eat? 9
  he didn't want to encourage anything here; but on the other hand he didn't want her swiping his salami
 not onions came the answer the following day
 must have really smelled up her sweater he thought and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen
 but then as he well knew women are not guided by logic or common sense
 now if this were vivian next door to him and if for some obscure female reason she kept her clothes in the refrigerator they would not be pink
 they would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid chic and splashy like vivian herself
 pink vivian once had told him was for baby girls and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy 5
 why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator? 10
  he mused aloud
 eh? 19
  it was mrs kirby making her toilsome way along the veranda laden with a clattery collection of mops brushes and pails 7
 what's that you say? 9
    oh nothing
 just glad the rain's stopped
 just look at that sky
 be a scorcher by afternoon
 i've got this cold
 she scrutinized him
 you want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash first sunny day
 i must remember to warn the girl next to you in larkspur 10
 that pale kind's the worst
 that pale kind charlie thought
 but then neither was peaked
 he could hear mrs kirby now warning her pale guest against sunburn
 i spoke to the fellow next door too she might say 6
 surely there was a better word
 charlie looked in the mirror
 frail feeble- peaked
 clearly two damp days with the bobbsey twins had done him no good
 the sun blazing hot as prophesied was far from kind to mrs kirby's varicolored properties
 when charlie came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill the whole establishment looked like a floodlit modern painting- great blocks of dizzy color punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators
 this weekend he thought he would look around for some more subdued retreat with cape roses maybe at the door
 he could not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside peony larkspur and the rest
 the sweater was gone from the refrigerator and in its place was a large plastic bag full of wet pink clothes
 no wonder she was so pale wearing all those cold clothes 7
 he got a red pill and a beer and then on impulse transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled be my guest on the wrapping
 it gave him a good feeling
 thanks was her answer the next day
 the note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript: you're not at all well are you? 7
    i've got this cold he wrote
 not that it was any of her business
 it's none of my business said the next note but my aunt elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold and she lived to be ninety-six
 i mean she's still living and she's ninety-six 9
 why don't you try that? 13
  i don't have a lemon
 he had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper
 by the next morning she had turned the paper over 8
 she didn't sound like a pale girl
 she sounded a little like a redhead
 but then redheads are often pale
 he stuck his head in mrs kirby's little rental office 7
 i guess that redhead next to me took your advice
 i haven't seen her on the beach
 you won't if you're looking for a redhead
 he spent that afternoon on the beach looking for a pale browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit
 there were pink bathing suits on blondes and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits
 there were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits
 up on a dune he saw a girl all by herself sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting
 he paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white- one of those bulky turtle- neck sweaters
 on the beach there were pale girls and not- so-pale girls 14
 and he saw them all as he walked up and down
 at two that morning he was still walking- up and down peony up and down the veranda up and down the silent moonlit beach 9
 finally in desperation he opened the refrigerator filched her hand lotion and left a note
 i've got this sunburn said the note and i used some of your hand lotion
 of course i don't mind she answered
 you're having a miserable time aren't you? 9
  use all the lotion you want and for goodness' sake stay in out of the sun for a couple of days
 this was a very warm sympathetic girl he decided 14
 sympathy is a fine quality in a woman
 now vivian for instance was not too long on sympathy 9
 she felt and said that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves; it was a tough world and you had to be tough to hold your own
 he didn't know what was so tough about vivian's world slopping around nassau with what's-his-name
 suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn? 9
  charlie couldn't see vivian offering any hand lotion 9
 she might peel him once the worst of the agony was over 7
 charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms waiting for the fire in his back to subside and used generous quantities of the hand lotion
 correspondence passed back and forth
 how's your sunburn now? 11
  the only thing this lotion has glycerin in it and that whitens the skin so if you're so anxious to get a tan you may not want to use it
 i'm not that anxious but maybe that's why you're so fair 7
 that mrs kirby! i'll bet she told you i was puny too 7
 how's your cold? 13
    broiled out
 she didn't say you were puny
 are you? 21
  what's puny? 10
    puny goes with pale and peaked
 do you have anything to read while you're shut up? 15
  there are two things here about surviving in the wilderness and a book called 'tom swift and his speedy canoe'; but the picture of tom swift is pretty sinister
 there was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot 17
 the new riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop
 for a few innings the anniston team couldn't figure him out 12
 then in the fifth anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field
 eddie lee riverside's redheaded playing manager ran after the ball but it rolled past him
 phil rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay
 eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to phil 8
 third! third base! eddie shouted
 phil spun around and made an accurate throw into mike deegan's hands on third base
 mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag 6
 but the anniston boy had begun his slide too late 11
 he came into the bag with his body and mike deegan brought the ball down full in his face
 you bastard! the anniston catcher screamed
 he jumped to his feet and started to throw punches 8
 mike deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher
 this brought in everybody from both sides while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar
 the fighters were separated in a few minutes 12
 but mike deegan was boiling mad now
 when the inning was over he cursed the anniston catcher all the way into the dugout
 phil rossoff coming in from left field stopped at the water fountain for a drink
 mike deegan was standing beside it facing the field 8
 he was eyeing the anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began
 keep your eyes open sonny! mike yelled to the catcher 9
 the anniston catcher did not reply with words
 he simply turned to mike and smiled
 this so infuriated deegan that he spun around and said: i'll get that little bastard
 so help me god i'll get him
 phil rossoff said: why don't you leave him alone? 6
  mind your own goddamn business mike deegan said 8
 he stepped into the dugout wondering why deegan was always looking for trouble
 maybe the answer was in his eyes
 when deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips 6
 in the last of the sixth inning mike deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder's head
 by the time the fielder got his hands on the ball deegan was rounding third base and heading for home
 the left fielder threw and it was a good one 16
 but mike had no chance of being tagged
 the anniston catcher was straddling home plate 11
 all deegan had to do was slide fall away but instead he rammed into the catcher
 both fell heavily to the ground
 only mike got to his feet
 he went back to touch home plate turned and walked to the dugout without looking back
 the anniston players and their manager ran out on the field 8
 they poured water over their catcher's face 13
 then the manager called for a doctor
 the riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer
 then quickly and a little nervously the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room
 mike deegan was sitting on the bench watching 10
 when the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said: that ought to teach the sonofabitch
 phil rossoff seated next to deegan got up and moved to the other end of the bench
 the anniston manager was coming over to the riverside dugout 7
 he was followed by four of his men
 it began to look as if something was going to happen 12
 mike sat quitely watching the manager come nearer 8
 eddie lee moved over to mike deegan's side
 no one said a word
 the anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of mike 8
 deegan the manager said his voice pitched low quivering 8
 that was a rotten thing to do
 for god's sake mike said waving the manager away
 stop it will you? 10
  tell your guys not to block the plate
 you didn't have to ram him
 the anniston manager looked at eddie lee
 it was a cold and calculated look
 he turned and went back across the field to his dugout 11
 he called in the pitcher who had been pitching and a big heavy powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for anniston 7
 the game started again and in the eighth inning mike deegan came up to bat
 everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting 7
 the first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for mike's head
 deegan fell into the dirt the ball going over him 7
 he arose slowly and brushed himself off
 he got back into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again
 hit the bum! somebody yelled from the anniston bench 8
 in the riverside dugout frankie ricco shortstop whispered into phil's ear: there's gonna be a fight
 look at those bastards! charlie haydon a pitcher said 14
 mike was slow getting into the box this time
 when he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in
 listen! he shouted to the pitcher
 one more and i'm coming out there!   i'll be waiting! the pitcher yelled back
 mike deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat 7
 he stood flat-footed in the box but not very close to the plate now
 the pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for mike's head
 deegan dropped got up turned and holding the bat with both hands up against his chest began to walk slowly out to the mound 7
 the pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards mike deegan
 they were both walking towards each other unhurried 14
 riverside and anniston players rushed out on the field 6
 in the next moment it seemed the infield was crowded with spectators ballplayers cops kids and a dog
 there was much shouting and screaming
 fights sprang up and were quickly squelched
 mike and the anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together
 phil rossoff and two other riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started
 after the game phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when mike deegan came in
 it's a helluva thing mike said looking at phil when a guy's own team-mate won't come out and help him in a fight
 phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head 6
 frankie ricco sat down on the bench near phil 10
 the other players were undressing quietly
 eddie lee had not come in yet
 mike went over to phil and stood over him
 why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me? 7
  i didn't think it was necessary
 well! now that's just fine! you didn't think it was necessary 8
 mike placed both his hands on his hips
 he pushed his jaw forward
 listen wise guy if you think i'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy
 mike had a good two inches over phil and phil had to look up into mike's face
 i didn't ask you to fight for the ball club phil said slowly 6
 you trying to say i started the fight? 14
    i'm not trying to say anything
 phil turned away and opened his locker and then he heard mike deegan say: you're yellow rossoff! and phil banged his locker door shut and spun around
 but before anything could happen frankie ricco was between them and eddie lee had come into the dressing room
 phil come into my office eddie said
 phil followed eddie into the office and shut the door 6
 he sat down before eddie's desk
 i'm doing you a favor eddie said quickly
 you get your unconditional release as of today
 phil's eyes widened just a trifle
 the best thing for you to do eddie said is go home 10
 you don't belong in professional baseball
 phil had to clear his throat
 is this because of what happened out there? 10
    no eddie said
 but it does confirm what i've suspected all along 11
 listen! this is the second time h   sit down sit down eddie said 8
 i'm not saying you're yellow
 i am saying you're not a professional ballplayer 13
 eddie lee leaned forward over the desk
 now listen to me phil
 i'm not steering you wrong
 you haven't got the heart for baseball
 phil shook his head and eddie frowned
 suddenly his voice grew hard
 what the hell do you think baseball is? 12
  you're not in the big leagues but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there? 6
  phil started to say something but eddie cut him short 6
 now don't tell me what a good ball player you are 8
 i know you've got talent
 but what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with 9
 you just haven't got the heart for pro-ball and that's it 8
 dazed phil said: i don't get it
 my batting average h   eddie stood up abruptly then sat down just as abruptly
 what difference does your batting average make? 13
  or your fielding average
 or even the way you run bases
 i tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win- you won't do it
 that's what i mean by no heart for the game
 deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there 6
 he did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on 8
 what the hell do you think baseball is? 10
  a sport? 21
  it's a way of life goddamit! and you've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who want to take your way of life away from you!   he's wrong! phil thought
 there were other clubs in this league
 he was a little pale and shaky
 his lips felt glued together
 i think you're wrong eddie he said finally
 you'll get your pay in the morning
 phil turned and left the room hearing eddie say: someday you'll see i was right
 phil shut the door behind him
 outside in the dressing room frankie ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes
 phil said: i got my release
 what for? 20
    phil sighed
 i don't get it
 i don't know phil said
 they were silent for a few moments
 then frankie said: what are you gonna do? 11
    phil started to take his clothes off and frankie sat down on the bench again
 phil took off one shoe and stared at it
 don't take it like this frankie said
 hell plenty of guys get let out and come back later 7
 the leagues are full of guys like that
 what are you gonna do phil? 19
    phil did not answer
 why not try another club? 16
    phil looked up
 what the hell right did eddie have saying a thing like that? 9
  springfield's in tomorrow frankie said
 he just didn't know what he was talking about saying a thing like that
 will you do it phil? 11
  do what? 15
    ask whitey for a job
 springfield come in tomorrow? 11
  frankie nodded
 i'll talk to him all right
 you'll get a job there
 i'm not worried about it phil said
 that's the way to talk
 what else did eddie have to say? 13
    nothing phil said
 richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity 9
 his broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him
 when he was twelve he took to reading st augustine and aquinas then lao-tse confucius mencius suzuki hindu tomes by endless krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers
 for his birthday because richard had seen them in a store and asked for them his mother bought him the zend-avesta and a little image of the indian god acala
 and one day on her own his mother came home with a present entitled the book of the dead which she suspected richard would enjoy
 he was enormously happy with her gift and smiled then went to his room to read
 at dinner one night when he was fourteen richard announced there is only one god
 did you think there were two? 11
  grinned his father
 you don't understand richard said gloomily
 through quiet laughter his mother said don't speak to your father like that richard
 richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again
 his interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in asian affairs 8
 although he still didn't speak to anyone he grew fond of saying the future lies in asia when the opportunity arose and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to new york to give him a foundation they said for his life in asian studies
 richard was a solitary student in new york and acquired in his remoteness a thorough if bookish knowledge of asian lore literature life politics and history
 he was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in tokyo and he packed up his clothes the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of acala and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country
 the week at home was not comfortable
 his mother who had seen little of him for four years appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an orient which she herself having slight knowledge of it had to be distrusted 5
 she seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested
 do you still have the book of the dead? 11
  she asked him and laughing she added i was nervous about buying a book with a title like that but i knew you'd like it 7
 yes he lied to shorten the conversation i still have it 7
 he was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father no matter the subject
 as for the book of the dead it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in new york
 he had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and trembling at having to open the big furnace given them up to the flames
 then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried
 richard left america with his clothes his biwa and his image of acala and on the freighter which took him to japan he plucked at the biwa trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient japanese tune he had once heard
 during his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure 5
 he stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty north pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water 7
 it was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it
 it was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind 14
 in tokyo richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in new york except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend 7
 an american student named charlotte adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her
 he had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of tokyo
 in charlotte richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which after a fashion he envied
 in time he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity
 she convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations
 at one such gathering charlotte announced i was at ryusenji today
 have you ever been to ryusenji? 10
  no one had
 well it's at fudomae and there was a tan young man quite naked taking a shower in the pool
 richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation but charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it
 three of the four persons present all foreign students in tokyo had been playing a game of judging popular japanese foods by the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy was used as the modifier 7
 soba udon and tea were in because they could be taken noisily 6
 sushi was out because it was pretentious
 sashimi was in samuel burns had suggested because it was too far out to stay out even if it was a little pretentious 7
 richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears
 he wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him said charlotte
 did you watch him? 17
  asked a red-haired girl named ceecee witter
 i shouldn't have been able to do that
 well i was able to do it charlotte said with no sign of irritation
 i'm surprised no one has been there
 i've been there a number of times
 sam i thought you knew everything about tokyo
 you've never been to ryusenji? 5
    i've heard about it samuel burns said
 there's a little place there called lovers mound dedicated to gompachi and komurasaki
 yes a little parkish place charlotte said and concluded anyhow it's all very nice
 and the man who brought sweet potatoes into kanto is buried there next to a beautiful seated statue of fudo
 oh that's what i meant to tell you
 this is the interesting part richard she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking
 there was that fellow out there in the bitter cold-   my god it was cold today said samuel burns
 and the water would be still colder ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it
 and your golden god said samuel burns probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath
 it would kill one of us
 but the point is charlotte said there he was freezing naked in a little stream of water at ryusenji all in worship of fudo the god of fire
 richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light
 it was true; fudo the god of wisdom was also thought of as the japanese version of acala
 the conversation went on but richard stopped listening 9
 he found himself trying to remember something but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall 8
 he had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black pacific was the memory for which he had been searching
 perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at ryusenji he was unable to put it together 8
 that night after leaving charlotte's apartment richard walked about for a time before returning to his room
 when he at last did go to his room he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of acala thinking first of charlotte's tale of the man at ryusenji then of his biwa and the invisible pacific waters
 and the next morning not sure of why he went he took the tra in to fudomae and walked to ryusenji
 he was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which charlotte had mentioned
 he went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool
 on the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of fudo or perhaps a demon
 the strange creature housed in wire made him shudder 8
 the sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach
 he left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him
 into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze; but the spirit he wished to call out would not he knew come in the person of the temple priest
 instead he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated fudo at their head 5
 the black fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and richard's eyes were caught by the fudo's in fascination and then richard was shocked as all at once flames shot out from the sharp features of fudo's face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it 6
 then the flames were gone the stillness fell upon the severe black face and richard began to tremble violently
 suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple never looking back
 he walked all the miles back to his room
 he seemed to have picked up a virus that day because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot
 he stayed home reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at ryusenji
 but the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day
 the cold lingered making sleep difficult that night and he remained in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal the wretched sound the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life
 all of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at fudomae
 i was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when i was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings 6
 it had grown hot early that day and i hoped that the boy my brother's son would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground carrying the jar of cool water
 the boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick along to play with
 he pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing tractor sounds with his lips 7
 i almost ran over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time
 i had turned at the corner of the field and i had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth and i was thinking of the boy and the water anyway and when i looked again down the furrow the snake was there
 it lay half in the furrow and half out and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when i put in the clutch 6
 the tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth and the tractor stopped instantly
 the snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made into the furrow and did not go any further 5
 i had never liked snakes much i still had that kind of quick panic that i'd had as a child whenever i saw one but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful
 he was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly
 go out of the furrow snake i said but it did not move at all 11
 i pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out hoping to frighten him with the noise but the snake only flicked its black forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern
 i let the engine idle then and i got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it
 my movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again and its tongue was working very rapidly
 i followed it looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back the colors clear and sharp and perfect in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a baby's fist down its back and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jet-black 5
 the colors were astonishing clear and bright and it was as if the body held a fire of its own and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin vivid and alive and warm
 the eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly
 his flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as i looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth 6
 you beauty i said i couldn't kill you
 you are much too beautiful
 i had killed snakes before when i was younger but there had been no animal like this one and i knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die
 i picked him up and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant fire-colored body like splendid ice and i knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him like fieldmice swallowed whole might make 5
 the body caressed through my hands like cool satin and my hands usually tanned and dark were pale beside it and i asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body
 i lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool newly-plowed earth from between my pale hands
 the snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods
 the sharp burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target
 i felt good and satisfied looking at the snake 11
 it shone in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself
 the color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien too in that dry and dusty and uncolored field
 i got on the tractor again and i had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks
 i had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house
 the earth was a little heavy and i had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly and i did not look back towards the place until i had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field a long way from where i had stopped because of the snake
 i saw it all at a glance
 the boy was there at the lower corner of the field and he was in the plowed earth stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience
 even at that distance with no sound but the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy 7
 i could see the hunched-up shoulders the savage determination the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick 5
 stop it i shouted but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on above anything i could say
 i stopped the tractor and i shouted down to the boy and i knew he could hear me for the morning was clear and still but he did not even hesitate in that brutal murdering dance
 i felt myself tremble thinking of the diamond light of that beauty i had held a few moments before and i wanted to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch the boy in the moment of his savagery and save a glimmer a remnant of that which i remembered but i knew it was already too late
 i drove the tractor on not looking down there; i was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on
 my head began to ache and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes and i hated the job suddenly and i thought there are only moments when one sees beautiful things and these are soon crushed or they vanish
 i felt the anger mount within me
 the boy waited at the corner with the jar of water held up to me in his hands and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning 0
 i knew the boy well
 he was eleven and we had done many things together 12
 he was a beautiful boy really with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and his eyelashes were long and dar k and brushlike and his eyes were blue
 he waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up as he would smile on any other day
 he was my nephew my brother's son handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well
 i saw then too the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil through something there where i had been not long before 8
 i stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me
 can i ride around with you? 13
  he asked as he often did and i had as often let him be on the tractor beside me
 i looked closely at his eyes and he was already innocent; the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his 7
 no you cannot i said pushing aside the water jar he offered to me
 i pointed to the splintered upright stake 15
 did you do that? 13
  i asked
 yes he said eagerly beginning a kind of dance of excitement 8
 i killed a snake; it was a big one
 he tried to take my hand to show me
 why did you kill it? 17
    snakes are ugly and bad
 this snake was very beautiful
 didn't you see how beautiful it was? 7
    snakes are ugly he said again
 you saw the colors of it didn't you? 9
  have you ever seen anything like it around here? 14
    snakes are ugly and bad and it might have bitten somebody and they would have died
 you know there are no poisonous snakes in this area 13
 this snake could not harm anything
 they eat chickens sometimes the boy said 13
 they are ugly and they eat chickens and i hate snakes 8
 you are talking foolishly i said
 you killed it because you wanted to kill it for no other reason 5
 they're ugly and i hate them the boy insisted
 it was beautiful i said half to myself
 the boy skipped along beside me and he was contented with what he had done
 the fire of the colors was gone; there was a contorted ugliness now; the colors of its back were dull and gray-looking torn and smashed in and dirty from the boy's shoes
 the beautifully-tapered head so delicate and so cool had been flattened as if in a vise and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted torn mouth
 the snake was hideous and i remembered even then the cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life
 i wrenched the stake out that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body between the colored diamond crystals 8
 i touched it and the coolness the ice-feeling was gone and even then it moved a little perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles and i hoped that it was truly dead so that i would not have to kill it 6
 and then it moved a little more and i knew the snake was dying and i would have to kill it there
 the boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips
 i'm sorry i thought to the snake for you were beautiful 5
 i took the broken length of it around the tractor and i took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and i struck its head not looking at it to kill it at last for it could never live
 the boy came around behind me dragging the stake 10
 it's a big snake isn't it? 8
  he said
 i'm going to tell everybody how big a snake i killed 3
 don't you see what you have done? 4
  i said
 don't you see the difference now? 4
  it's an ugly terrible snake he said
 he came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes 10
 i could see the happiness in the boy's eyes the gleeful brutality
 i could have slapped the boy
 he looked up at me puzzled and he swayed his head from side to side
 i thought you little brute you nasty selfish little beast with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes 8
 i wanted to slap his face to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth and i decided then very suddenly what i would do
 cady didn't come unglued easily but this had not been a day of glad tidings
 tax worries production worries personnel worries and the letter from hanford college his own alma mater a real snapper
 hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago 7
 yes the boy's credentials were in order- scholastic transcript character references picture health record successful college boards
 but due to the many applicants on file would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation interests a nd his qualifications for leadership? 7
    cady partlow lit his pipe with no comfort
 this was the letter which would or would not enroll his son david in hanford
 his son who had nev er held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life
 his son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor lawyer merchant or chief
 he wondered if he had played it wrong
 maybe he should have kept in touch
 but he had been busy building a business being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at hanford class of 1935 6
 besides cady partlow knew he wasn't the old-grad-type 10
 look at pete alcorn who hadn't missed a hanford ball game in fifteen years
 hanford college little ivy league had no room for football players with low grades
 cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride 6
 good solid b average with a sprinkling of a's in math and science 7
 imagine his son being that good in science! mr partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at hanford
 but then he hadn't studied very hard
 getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking
 he put down his pipe and started to type
 in response to your letter i can in good conscience recommend my son david in the field of leadership
 he stopped and looked at the picture of his son the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for hanford college
 he didn't have to be told his son looked like him 6
 david had the same gray eyes high cheekbones dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness
 he turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence 11
 his interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics tennis and swimming
 his chief motivation for enrolling at hanford is the desire to-   mr partlow banged his fist on the keyboard ruining the letter 5
 he paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build
 how do you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do? 7
  that you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club of course david has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer- or a lawyer or an editor? 7
    how do you tell a college like hanford that your son has a vast potential that he will find himself? 7
  just give him time give him a chance
 cady snapped the venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter rolled in a fresh sheet and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head
 what a production to make of a letter commending your own son! his eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic 8
 he told hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics
 he told hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities
 he belonged to a social club a civic group little theater swimming team and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club
 he finished with a flurry of good wishes to hanford college and signed the letter
 then he met the grave eyes of his wife anne from the photograph next to david's
 he shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket 10
 better show it to anne and see if he had omitted anything 7
 after all his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of partlow products
 anne had a way with words
 half of it was natural half was smith college
 yet the whole of anne was something she had never learned in any college
 a woman had it or she didn't
 she said what she meant and let it be
 she never got on his back
 he could take the advice or leave it
 he whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator
 you look like you just heard a real gasser mr partlow 8
 cady looked at tom who had taken him up and down for fifteen years
 i was just thinking how things have changed
 when i went to college they begged you to come 12
 be our guest! it's our pleasure! now you have to be well rounded firm in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge!   tom slid open the door to the lobby
 that's a fact mr partlow
 my john applied to six colleges before he got in 7
 he's president of the rocket club here you know 6
 always messing around with science stuff
 real bright along those lines you might say
 he got a science scholarship to yale
 oh said mr partlow that's fine tom
 as he drove home through the thinning traffic cady felt the unease growing
 he hadn't told anyone but he too had applied to five colleges for david
 they had all turned down his son
 limited interests
 he suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the martini anne had waiting for him 5
 but tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket
 nor did looking at anne ease the tension as it usually did 7
 he liked looking at anne
 he liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose
 from those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as david did
 she always could sense the shag end of a woolly day 8
 board meeting tonight cady? 12
  no i begged off
 can i have the car dad? 10
    why not let him take it cady? 10
  i know it is midweek but it's only eight days before commencement
 cady deep in thought neither heard nor answered 7
 carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly mr chairman!   cady partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse
 the car? 18
  of course you can have it
 dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else slowly methodically and with interest
 hear anything from hanford yet dad? 9
  cady begged the question
 don't worry about it dave
 your acceptance will come through
 dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys 8
 don't be too sure dad
 charles burke got turned down by dartmouth and he is a straight-a student
 anne said it wasn't surprising because charles was antisocial a lone wolf and completely one-sided
 i can hardly say the same about you dave!   dave kissed her lightly
 girls my dear parent are here to stay! get my old man to bed early
 he looks a little bit frayed
 anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot
 let's go into the library
 you do seem somewhat tattered
 cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room
 i didn't know i looked so dilapidated! wrong word darling 6
 your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it 8
 need any help? 13
    in a way yes
 hanford college hasn't decided on dave's application yet 6
 they want a letter from me on his motives interests and leadership 8
 cady handed her the letter drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence
 already he could feel anne's questioning eyes 10
 i know you wrote this in a hurry but cady dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days
 that was when half the school was down with flu 12
 and he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club 9
 he just took over the week bill daley was in the state basketball play-off
 cady stuck his jaw out
 the fact remains he was treasurer
 no cady he made second team
 a team is a team insisted cady
 anything else? 15
    yes she said quietl y
 i don't think you've been quite honest cady
 astronomy
 he was mad about stars at the age of nine
 geology you and dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago! those aren't his interests now 7
 what do you suggest? 10
    just say he likes swimming tennis chess and music 10
 music! he hasn't been to a symphony concert all season 6
 but he plays bass with chief crazy horse and his five colts!   you mean that rock-and-roll combo? 9
  even in that he never solos like jack on guitar or rich on sax
 he's- he's just there that's all
 he keeps the beat going
 he likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo 7
 he doesn't like to rise and shine
 don't worry cady he'll be back in the beethoven fold by next year 4
 but i refuse to be brutally honest and mention chief crazy horse and his five colts
 anne laughed and cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck
 maybe i am padding it a bit anne he said
 but you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college 13
 he has to have leadership as well as grades 15
 anne folded the worrisome document
 did you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend? 7
  he hasn't used it now for several years
 can you really say his motivation for college is electronics? 8
    cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel
 and what would you say he wants to do? 10
  just what? 24
    it's dave who is applying to hanford college 7
 why don't you ask him? 13
  for once cady partlow wished anne would yell at him so he could yell back
 i have talked to him but you know i've never tried to push him into any profession
 i won't be guilty of trying to run his life
 anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild
 just because your father tried to make a banker out of you you've leaned over backward to keep your hands off
 but subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold 11
 you want him to be a leader of men like you 11
 cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder 9
 dave has qualities of leadership
 he just hasn't developed them yet
 he never will cady
 not the kind of leadership you mean working with lots of people 10
 all your wishful thinking won't change that
 remember what you used to say in the army? 13
  you can't run a war with ninety-nine generals and one private!   cady walked the block to the mailbox almost ashamed of himself for arguing with anne
 martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all
 and once begun had grown to such monstrous proportions 9
 the pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life 10
 lying awake at night he could see them laid out on the floor of his mind
 when he rose in the morning the image was still there 9
 he had always been a messy and negligent man 10
 in his bachelor days his bedroom had been strewn with clothes which his mother or later the hotel maid generally saw fit to put in order
 no doubt dolores resented following in their footsteps 10
 but it was fun those first days kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug
 there was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up
 half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things 8
 he remembered the first time he saw her standing across the room at a party
 the smooth curve of her neck very white against hair which curled against it like petals
 her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as black but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness
 so he sought her out and spoke to her and thought of his hand in her hair
 or against her back pressed on the column of vertebrae which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises like the snapped stem of a tulip 4
 but to put it bluntly nothing snapped
 yet that had not seriously troubled him not then 9
 more he could take at leisure
 all martin thought he needed was time: to what better use could time be put? 6
  he saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly 10
 there was too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting 5
 they had left themselves too much to discover
 but at the start his new life felt invigorating 16
 it was on the tenth day after the wedding that he dropped the shorts on the floor
 now i'm not going to pick up those shorts! martin gave her a teasing pat
 i think you'll get tired of them there
 in the morning the shorts were where he had left them 12
 he smiled to himself and decided not to mention them till dolores did
 it was almost too easy
 for he had just remembered: tonight they were having their first guests
 the shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening
 the rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts 8
 they gave the room a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face
 he saw that dolores intended to wait until the last minute thinking he would get nervous
 quietly he determined to foil her
 i can be as stubborn as she can he thought; my nerves are as strong
 she'll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings 7
 martin was standing a few feet from the front door 9
 he swung around eyes toward the bedroom some fifteen feet away 7
 dolores stood motionless in the doorway
 he could not cross the living room brush past her and bend down to retrieve the shorts
 he strode to answer the bell
 bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet
 with the most casual and relaxed manner in the world dolores led anthea to the bedroom
 at first he could not be sure
 then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there
 a glissade of giggles slid over their voices
 all evening anthea favored him with odd coy looks 10
 clearly she had been instructed not to say a word 8
 for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic
 at last there was a void no one could fill
 the brainards went home early
 martin realized later on that he should have had it out with dolores that night
 but he was so taken aback he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in
 on the contrary it would only weaken his position if he fumed while she stayed calm and adamant
 and if he surrendered after raving at her 16
 suppose he ran up the white flag altogether? 9
  at once
 he considered the sober possibilit y
 in his head was the echo of those titters with anthea 7
 there was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean
 he remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs where he crouched listening
 he could even recall the last time he sat there
 she was talking about him that time because he had done some bad thing something she disliked but afterwards martin said he was sorry 9
 he apologized so sweetly i couldn't keep being annoyed with him 7
 it wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time; he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened which was as honest as he could put it
 but his mother told the story over and over till her martin said he was sorry was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin pallid ears
 the battle had to be fought
 let the best sex win
 but his resolution hardly seemed to help
 if the situation had been bad it now got worse 10
 about this time people began dropping in considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough
 angrily martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip- preferably one that lasted months- instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away
 here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by 13
 these stray people nearly always insisted on dolores showing them around the apartment
 of course the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts
 it was curious how the different visitors took this 13
 some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's countenance 9
 to them all dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale 7
 it's a little contest martin and i have she would begin gaily carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course 4
 while he waited in the living room
 they entered the bedroom and dolores said nothing 11
 then one of the guests showed his merriment
 you were in a hurry weren't you? 14
  martin would have liked to break the man's neck 7
 dolores smiled; she let the interpretation stand 9
 now martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature 7
 with her eyes dolores dared him for the truth ready to begin: it's a little contest-   never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment
 they kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations 8
 but martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything 11
 what to talk about? 19
    dolores kept picking up any of his clothes which he left about but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions 7
 he fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers 6
 in his moments of worst agony martin imagined what his friends were saying
 the sound of their amazement
 bizarre: he could hear the word
 we were up to visit them and h   he had thought her exactly what he wanted
 six weeks of marriage and i'm using the past tense he told himself furiously
 pursuing his idea he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now
 everyone would know why; he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure
 day and night martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself
 his mind scurried frantically seeking an exit 10
 alternately he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly morosely to live out his life in this fashion 5
 nothing would change nothing would ever change
 when the solution finally came to him one night while he was in bed he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before
 in a frenzy of excitement he considered his plan 12
 beside his shorts he would place something of hers 6
 instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory for if she picked up say a pair of her panties she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside- the expenditure of energy was almost the same
 he felt that it would be a particular humiliation to dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor 8
 furthermore he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly: every time he went in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle next to his shorts
 sooner or later dolores would crack
 on the other hand if she didn't remove her own things it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment
 martin guessed that dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story
 the tale he thought would become less gay
 she had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness his lack of control his general male looseness while she remained cool airy and untouched the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body
 to have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd
 something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith that the idea would work because he believed in it since his courage and virility were involved because it was truly his
 the knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism
 the next morning while dolores was out of the room he went to her bureau drawer took out a pair of nylon lace pants and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts
 he sat down on the bed
 in a surprisingly short time dolores appeared 12
 to his delight her eyes focused at once upon the two garments 7
 slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers then hesitated for about a second 5
 ah he thought she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too 6
 he saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him
 extending her fingers another inch she caught up the shorts and swiftly left the room
 she did not look at him but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady
 they breakfasted together but martin did not refer to his triumph and dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible
 well martin thought that'll save
 he left for work in high spirits
 as he relaxed that day martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks
 he found that he no longer hated dolores and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling
 good old a-z cap said
 you know i've got one of your cars at home 13
 as a prominent industrialist you ought to be interested in his nibs' support group
 isn't his racket down your alley? 6
    once it was william thought
 a rush of memory swept him back and he forgot cap 9
 how did he start on such a ride to brief glory? 8
  simply enough through the inadvertent agency of his brother- in-law
 general hershey's draft and doc eddyman and cap were responsible for his first eminence but fearless freddy bryan could take credit if he cared to for the second time
 freddy needed a job having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by gerry and it was up to arthur willis to provide him with one
 mr willis bought zenith plastic products a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on long island engaged in working out government contracts and installed freddy in an executive position
 shortly after freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas 9
 willis listened patiently and once in a while william was exposed to them at a family gathering; he generally heard freddy's suggestions without interest being absorbed by his own prospering concerns
 probably mr willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren 7
 gerry began to aid freddy with her father prodded no doubt by joan's open contempt for freddy and william's irritating competency 5
 another factor must have been the eventual disposal of willis' fortune; she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with freddy the more likely he was to reward freddy richly upon his death 7
 whatever the reasons willis and bryan started expanding zenith 9
 they acquired another electronics factory a specialized ceramics company an organization that built- very experimentally- high-speed research calculators
 since they were hunting for national defense contracts adam herberet a man of surprising resources entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections
 feeling his power freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer 8
 heavy industry slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers attracted him
 the allstates auto company a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment had recently constructed an over-large modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism
 cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders it was ripe for amalgamation and freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash and never mind inevitable consequences
 with herberet's blessing he was convinced that allstates' wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly tanks missiles or ordnance of some kind
 at that point william came into the picture
 although not much desiring the account he had been appointed advertising head of zenith
 freed of routine by havi ng his own firm and a complaisant partner his work in new york had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure; and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities
 mr willis eager to have him allied with the family wanted advice beyond the confines of his field and william set out on a serious study of the situation including trips to wisconsin and washington 7
 in the end he said: i'm not enchanted by the proposition sir 11
 i know a guy named jack hamrick a very bright young engineer who was with chrysler and i took him with me to allstates 8
 it's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind
 the conversion will cost a fortune
 besides that i'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the air force 6
 i think adam herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side 8
 missiles have thrown everything up for grabs and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here
 the future of manned aircraft is in doubt which affects government procurement and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade- one jet can take the place of three compound-engine planes 7
 this means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough
 here are a few facts and figures i've assembled 14
 can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles? 5
    willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged 8
 well he said there is freddy you know h
 freddy is deeply committed to our plans already 9
 he assures me he has people to handle the money raising and ham richert my lawyer says the legal aspects of the wedding of zenith and allstates are no problem
 i don't like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution
 i wish you wouldn't tell freddy i'm lukewarm; i've caused him trouble before and he's beginning to resent me
 if we don't take care the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides brandishing their cudgels
 which is a frightful prospect bill
 one shouldn't mix commercial affairs with patriarchy but in this case i have no choice h
 let me think about it
 i'm most grateful to you so grateful i wish you were my principal aide instead of freddy
 not to william's surprise freddy adam and hamilton richert prevailed; allied to them was gerry devoting much time to swaying her father and joan dismissed all thought of the project and william was unwilling to interfere further
 zenith absorbed allstates stock transfers were arranged and freddy became president of the hyphenated combination 8
 through jack hamrick william fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for shoals and clay
 he forgot about a-z till unhappily he and hamrick were proved correct
 freddy's backing dropped away from him and mr willis was forced to make up the deficit
 adam beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of t he new corporation couldn't deliver from his end
 the wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant 10
 stock willis held in abundance fell sharply in value 9
 confronted by a grim future freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation
 once more willis summoned william
 you were right he said- you and your engineer- and i'm in something of a bind
 freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me
 in addition to other defects i'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment
 will you see if you can help me? 14
    william spent a long week end closeted with hamrick 7
 his recent experience in motor car advertising a love for cars of themselves the existence of a-z's useless wisconsin set-up exposure to exciting conceptions of hamrick 's that nobody would buy and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called ticonderoga motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it
 initially hamrick's reaction to a-z going into the passenger car market was discouraging
 he thought the financing the advertising the production of new models the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult
 if a-z could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment if william could hit precisely the right promotion note if the money hurdle was not insurmountable h 5
 they took nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics and put their arguments down in black and white
 taking hamrick with him william went to mr willis 7
 he was surprised and dubious but impressed by the engineer and the report
 your alternative is breathtaking he said and i'm frank in saying a bit mad
 i wish i was younger and less timid h
 well i can't resolve this myself
 i'll have to call in the brain trust
 are you willing to run the gantlet? 11
  i can't guarantee you a sympathetic audience
 we'll be in there swinging william said but in a way sir you've got to decide it yourself
 you have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours- and besides nobody else is going to have the courage 10
 if they follow anyone it'll have to be you
 i should explain: there's more here for me than advocating my little dream there's you
 you mustn't take a fall or publicly back away
 you're- you're arthur willis h
 forgive the hearts and flowers theme
 i rather like the music willis replied quietly 14
 at the meeting attended by freddy richert herberet and the a- z executive staff with mr willis presiding william and hamrick did indeed run the gantlet
 from shock and incredulity most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity
 oh my god ham richert said a little child shall lead them 6
 it's absurd bill freddy said from a pale face
 you're leading dad down the garden path
 your garden god damn it! william said
 i don't enjoy family quarrels adam said
 we're here to transact business
 can't we put an end to this arthur? 8
  hear me out please william begged
 i'm an advertising hustler i admit but i have to get hot once in a larger sphere
 sure ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the big three
 their cars weren't small enough they didn't have the power they were old-fashioned
 they tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit 10
 we've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery
 we've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age
 look what those little european jobs are doing
 we'll woo the consumer with a product not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight
 let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seductio n at reasonable rates
 ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon before the tide changed still honest and stupid- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again- waiting for us ready-made 6
 we've got rid of the steam yachts and georgian houses and the bloated too-expensive automobile is next
 why not come down smartly in the world in a chic fashion with an allstates-zenith? 12
    he swayed them somewhat but the debate raged on 9
 financing emerged as the main obstacle
 mr willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum 8
 nobody will underwrite it i'm telling you freddy said 8
 i know what i'm talking about in that department 9
 there's plenty of risk money ham richert added but not for anything this risky
 we'll try to swing the deal on that basis
 if we can't raise the capital we're through
 you're up against it anyhow
 why won't you give me a chance? 12
    a silence fell
 heads instinctively turned in willis' direction
 he smiled at william and slowly rubbed his hands together 9
 i feel i must answer the question he said since the onus later if any should fall on me- i don't relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family h
 i'm not giving you a chance bill but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance
 all the in-laws have got to have their day adam said and glared at william and freddy in turn
 sweat started out on william's forehead whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell
 across the table hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger
 spike-haired burly red-faced decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an ivy league suit jack hamrick awaited william at the officers' club
 hello boss he said and grinned
 i suppose i can never expect to call you 'general' after that washington episode
 it was among these that hinkle identified a photograph of barco! for it seems that barco fancying himself a ladies' man had listed himself for mormon beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said: with your beard dear you ought to be in movies!   mills secured barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge rushed to the hollywood police station to report the theft and less than five minutes later detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of cal barco
 on their way they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants
 finally at ye olde gasse filling station on avocado avenue they learned that their man having paused to get oil for his car had asked about the route to san diego
 they headed in that direction and at san juan capistrano by-the-sea came upon barco sitting in the quaint old spanish mission drive-in eating a hot tamale
 at the moment barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his convertible which in their quest for the stolen lap rug they proceeded to search
 the robe however was missing for by that time barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in glendale
 the detectives placed barco under arrest and without informing him of the nature of the charge took him back to hollywood for questioning
 thus it was that barco apprehended for mere larceny now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered 7
 during the return trip barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases such as: they're under sand dunes h they're better off i tell you h i saved their souls
 the detective commenting on barco's behavior felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged- that he was a more or less harmless nut!   however while in his cell awaiting trial for theft barco in a fit of apprehension made an attempt to take his own life
 the attempt had failed because when endeavoring to cut his wrists this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood 7
 the jail authorities- attaching no particular significance to the episode- offered barco whisky to revive him; but the old fellow a lifelong teetotaler refused it and no more was thought of the matter 5
 then it was that district attorney welch entered the case 13
 a man of vaulting ambition with one eye on the mayorship of los angeles nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity
 it was reported to welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide
 welch wanted to know why
 now welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at
 the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test
 so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly:   barco we've got the goods on you! it'll be a lot better if you come clean
 at first barco was evasive and shifty
 but with welch's relentless pursuit of the subject barco finally broke and started confessing to one murder after another
 by the time barco reached the count of three the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true
 but if true it was the case of which he had dreamed the case which would throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great murder trial
 welch summoned jail officials to barco's cell
 but to welch's chagrin the police captain pooh-poohed welch's credulity in barco's confession
 barco was clearly a nut
 it required strength bravado daring to commit murder 13
 that worm a murderer? 16
  ridiculous! then for the first time since his arrest a glint of spirit lit barco's eyes
 his manhood had been attacked
 he stiffened and rose to his fee t
 he'd show them! is that so? 8
  he queried
 well for ten years i've been murdering women 10
 i can lead you to every one of the bodies and there ain't four nor five nor six of 'em- there's seven! the next day the police captain in derision organized what he termed welch's wild goose chase
 for indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it even in hollywood 5
 the searching party consisted of the police captain welch barco policemen with shovels newspaper reporters and cameramen 7
 barco his state of apprehension gone never to return had assumed a matter- of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on
 he directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica
 stopping the cars at a fork in the road he got out paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills and indicated a location
 orders were given to dig
 welch was worried
 the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again barco's pride was aroused
 with greater precision he again paced off a location this time a little more to the left
 with quibs and gibes the policemen again started digging 8
 the captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object
 there's something here! said the digger
 joking stopped and everyone gathered around
 the digger thrusting about with his shovel now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's hollywood sport shirts
 although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains it was enough
 welch was wild with delight
 his elation grew as barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another
 now did welch truly become the man of the hour and everything that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph for him
 it went to his head and his ambition increased 11
 it was apparent that welch was in cahoots with marshall and would use his pow er as da to drag every possible sensation into the case
 every new scandal which would provide more copy for marshall's pen would thus mean more publicity for welch
 i knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola was called to the stand 9
 once there the da with devilish cleverness would provide marshall with headlines: viola's multiple romancesh viola lake an addicth downfall of another film idol! it would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl!   i studied welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted 4
 it wasn't long before i sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for viola's destruction 8
 he was bitter and resentful toward her personally resentful 10
 a dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward viola's favors- or even more serious perhaps that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap
 i did not rest until i had tracked the mystery down 9
 one day over a year before there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel
 viola had been urged to attend by telephone and not knowing the host or the character of the party she had gone
 she arrived late and as she entered the party noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority; the air was thick with smoke empty bottles were in evidence and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor
 naturally viola had no wish to remain but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival in all politeness to her host 5
 and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds; while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which as fate would have it belonged to district attorney welch 6
 as viola sat there a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and as a prank insert rosebuds between the toes
 a little later the district attorney woke up emerged from under the couch looked at his watch and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture forum on the civic spirit of the southland in the byzantine room of the hotel where his wife as president of the forum was to preside
 he made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off neatly arranged his hair and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed
 then noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds he made his way to the byzantine room and with his usual dignity mounted the rostrum
 the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined
 the incident aside from reflecting on welch's political career had all but wrecked his home life
 he never rested until he discovered who the culprit was and when he did he vowed vengeance on viola lake if ever the chance came his way 6
 and here it was! by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion
 during these first days of the trial i didn't have as much time to commiserate with viola as i should have liked
 in the first place it was difficult for us to meet 15
 we couldn't be seen together for the tongue of scandal was ever ready to link our names and the tongue of scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl no matter how innocent 5
 i couldn't invite viola to our house for mother snobbishly refused to receive her
 now the czarship had not affected my own sense of social values but mother had attained a reflected glory through it which had opened the doors of los angeles-pasadena society to her 5
 there mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the budweisers the chalmers and the heinzes 
 i hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats 8
 but mother insisted for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts
 in fact it was not until the king of spain had visited at pickfair that mary and doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoi-polloi
 mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educated abroad and with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school
 but at long last came a time wh en i broke away from mother and her society chi-chi in order to spend a cosy evening with viola and her chaperon at her home
 however such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world society and even alas to my own mother 7
 when i arrived at viola's i was shown to my surprise into the kitchen
 viola greeted me in checked apron ladle in hand and explained it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner
 i sat and watched proceedings
 there was to be roast chicken with dressing giblet gravy asparagus new peas with a sprig of mint creamed onions and mashed potatoes- all chosen prepared and cooked by viola herself
 i realized that hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem but his agony could have been no greater
 the most that was accomplished was adding mrs beige's tray to the dish pile and by means of repeated threats on an ascending scale seeing that the girls dressed themselves after a fashion 6
 i was saved from making the decision as the phone rang and the girls were upon me instantly
 here's a household hint: if you can't find your children and get tired of calling them pick up the phone
 no matter if your children are at the movies in school visiting their grandmother or on a field trip in some distant city they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick up the phone 5
 jennie and miranda twined themselves around me murmuring endearments
 louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which i was trying to hold the phone claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency
 somehow managing to get out a cool poised won't you hold on a second please i covered up the mouthpiece and with more warmth and less poise gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter including devil's island and the remoter reaches of siberia 6
 i promised to illustrate the lecture if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed
 speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller i resumed my everyday voice
 soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black out miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table and various screeches thuds and giggles
 under the circumstances i had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone but when i hung up i was reasonably certain that francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening and how important it was that hank and i be there 6
 i discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen and were playing quietly in the living room
 it seemed that i would be the gainer if i accepted the peace and quiet instead of carrying out my threats
 resolving to get something done i started in on the dishes 7
 i'm not saying it right
 what i meant to say was that i started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink 6
 they looked so formidable however so demanding that i found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again this time about francesca and her husband
 how about them i thought
 francesca and herbert were among the few people we knew in catatonia
 we didn't even know them till about a month after we moved- at that time they had called on us after i met fran at a pta meeting and had taken us in hand socially
 they had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners and for information as to where to shop which dentist doctor plumber and sitter to call just a village; the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly 
 herb an expert on narrow ties thin lapels and swatches was men's fashion editor of parvenu the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation
 fran and he had met about two years after she had arrived in manhattan from nebraska or was it wyoming? 7
  she was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and having arrived in new york with a big bank roll became a dabbler in various fields
 she patronized greenwich village artists for awhile then put some money into a broadway show which was successful
 it was during her writing period that she and herb met and decided that they were in love
 they were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers and then they honeymooned in bermuda
 bermuda was not in style that year
 they had honeymooned in rome; everyone was very high on rome that year
 they had bought their house in catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding new york; they had chosen catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools beaches and abundance of names
 you are bound to get involved with people when you have children fran had told me at our first meeting so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands but people who do things 6
 i admired their easy way of doing things but i couldn't escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things 5
 their house was a centuries-old colonial which they had had restored and updated and added on to
 it had a gourmet's corner a breakfast room a luncheon room a dining room a sitting room a room for standing up a party room dressing rooms for everybody even a room for mud
 it was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room paint in the painting room play with blocks in the block house and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time 7
 their two boys were well adjusted and like their parents always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences 5
 francesca and herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects 
 fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against the catatonia uniform of bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by wearing bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in color; bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes
 sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid unrelieved black and with her blonde hair cut so closely wearing this uniform she strongly resembled a member of the ss
 no one could dislike them i thought
 sometimes though they did not seem quite human 10
 it seemed indeed that their house was not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play and had talent enough to fill the roles competently with nice understatement
 practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing names; even brand names
 you should hear the reverence in fran's voice when she said baccarat or steuben or madame alexander
 she always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy and that koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs
 i wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of catatonia were equally unreal
 i couldn't feel at home among them
 besides francesca there was blanche
 francesca was pleasant and charming but blanche was sweet 8
 yes blanche was very very sweet- being in her company was like being drowned in warm melted marshmallows
 i had once been a witness when blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness oh my souffle has collapsed
 anyone knows how a real red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe! if blanche had been honest she would have yelled slammed at least a couple of doors and thrown a few little valueless things 5
 but dear me no; not blanche
 after five minutes with blanche one might welcome the astringency of grazie who was a sort of gwen cafritz to francesca's perle mesta
 francesca and grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen equal bosses of whatever pta or civic project was being launched
 they were inseparable not because they were fond of each other but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other as they were keen rivals for social leadership
 grazie was mean: quietly mean and bitterly unfunnily sarcastic 8
 she it was who had looked to see if i was wearing shoes upon learning that i couldn't drive
 grazie had a small slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast
 she lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration appointments paint and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring; the pets were a couple of siamese cats
 her uniform was of rich raw silk in a shade which matched her hair skin housepaint and cats and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless she rather resembled a frozen fish stick
 the husbands of these women and others i had met in catatonia were distinguished only in that they were to me at least indistinguishable
 i couldn't tell one from the other
 like herbert they were all in communications: radio television magazines and advertising
 one or two were writers of books; all were fellows of finite charm
 each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and the habit of saying zounds! in deference to country-squirehood
 i never thought i'd live to hear people chuckle and say zounds! in real life
 i wouldn't have missed it for anything
 they were sincere- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile
 these boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs while they gazed misty-eyed with care into the eyes of the person they were meeting 6
 could such unadulterated love for a total stranger be credited? 9
  they were always leaping to light cigarettes open car doors fill plates or glasses and i mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that i mistrusted bake shops that called themselves sanitary bake shops
 o pioneers! i thought and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal mister
 i sighed thinking that among other things people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85000 yearly; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on person to person; people who thought it was nice to be important but not important to be nice; who were more ingratiating than gracious more personalities than persons
 in my estimation they were people who read daphne du maurier and discussed kafka; well not discussed him exactly but said kafka! reverently and raised their eyes as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about kafka which they were because they had no opinions about kafka not having read kafka
 they were i felt people invariably trying to prove not who but what they were and trying to determine what not who others were 6
 becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime i brought myself back to the tasks at hand
 i made plans for the afternoon- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once making the beds and then maybe painting the kitchen
 then i remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week
 bananas! jennie had shouted each time
 they're not dessert! they're not even food
 they're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast
 i dug around and found a mix and was able to surprise them with a devil's-food cake with chocolate icing
 rule for cooking: if you can't put garlic in it put chocolate in the cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills mama had been providing 3
 then jennie closed her eyes stretched forth her arms and said: take my hand louise; i'm a stranger in paradise
 needless to say i was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise
 how dared they demand to snoop in private financial records disbursements confidential contracts and agreements? 8
  it is as though i said on the historic three-hour coast- to-coast radio broadcast which i bought and p re-empting the eddie cantor manhattan merry- go-round and that man in the white house like some despot of yore insisted on reading my diary raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie! my impassioned plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the eddie cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis 4
 but what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation? 6
  the savage barbarian hordes of red russian communism descended on the athens that was mighty metronome sacking and despoiling with their bolshevistic battle cry of soak the rich'! after an unspeakable siege lasting the better part of two months it was announced that the studio owed the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while i who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary i had earned and the little i legally inherited as morris' helpless relict was stung with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to wipe out all but a fraction of my poor hard-come-by savings 4
 i was also publicly reprimanded dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as the new republic the new yorker time and the christian science monitor
 it was then that i availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional
 the litigation was costly and seemingly endless
 i fought like a tigress but by the time i appealed my case to the supreme court mr roosevelt and his henchmen had done their dirty work all too well even going so far as to attempt to pack the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me
 presidential coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers toadies and sycophants of the bench against me but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me! i was ready like portia to present my own brief 7
 but the supreme court wouldn't even hear my case! my plea was unanimously voted down and thrown out
 again my name was on all the front pages 10
 i was it seemed persona non grata in every quarter but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence
 as charles evans hughes said miss poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a litigant
 albert einstein was quoted as saying: the workings of the woman's mind amaze me
 henry ford spoke of me as utterly astounding
 heywood broun wrote: belle poitrine is the most original thinker since caligula and even fdr had to concede that if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of miss poitrine america would rapidly resemble ancient babylon and nineveh 5
 not only were the court costs prohibitive but i was subjected to crippling fines in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid debts which the governmen claimed that metronome and i owed- a severe financial blow
 nor as manny said had the notoriety done my career any good 6
 my enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as reactionary robber baroness and even traitor! traitor indeed! i point now with pride to the fact that long ere the committee on un-american activities the minute women the economic council and other such notable watchdog organizations were so much as heard of i was hollywood's leading bulwark against communism fighting single-handedly creeping socialism against such insuperable odds as the fascio-communist troops of the nra pwa wpa ccc and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries whom fdr employed secretly through the transparent ruse of regular relief checks
 needless to say my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period
 could it do otherwise? 13
  even though i have always had a genius for throwing myself into every role and playing it for all it's worth no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune her reputation her livelihood her home and her nation itself are all imperilled
 such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to oscar winning performances
 i tried my hardest with little help may i say from my husband and leading man but somehow the outside pressures were too severe 6
 having achieved stardom a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote letch proceeded to neglect them all
 never a quick study he now made no attempt to learn his lines and many a mile of film was wasted many a scene- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow thespians- was taken thirty forty fifty times because miss poitrine's co-star and helpmate had never learned his part
 each time letch went up in his lines i was the one to be patient helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament profanity and abuse blaming others going into sulks and on more occasions than i care to count storming off the set for the rest of the day
 as for his finances i was never privileged to know exactly how much money letch had salted away
 it was i who paid for our little home the food the liquor the servants- even letch's bills at his tailor and the los angeles athletic club
 never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw
 as for his private monies they were rapidly dissipated in drinking gaming and carousing
 more than once i was confronted by professional gamblers bookies loan sharks gangsters thugs and finger men- people of a class i did not even know existed- to repay my husband's staggering losses or else h i shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu
 and at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls with the commonest of accents telephoned to announce to me that letch had sired their unborn children! having the deepest of maternal instincts my heart fairly bled when i thought of the darling pink and white bundles from heaven i would have proudly given my husband
 ah you're too old was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever i suggested starting a family
 letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter
 i now felt it wiser to keep baby-dear in school and- during the summers- at a camp run by the society of friends all year around 5
 her presence only made letch more distant and irritable and in the hurry of buying chateau belletch i had neglected to consider a room for baby-dear so there was no place to put her anyhow 6
 in his infinite wisdom wants us to have these inexplicable little yet i adored this man letch feeley why i cannot say 6
 with faint heart and a brave smile i endured his long absences from chateau belletch his coldness his indifference his slights and his abuse
 the times i can recall when i was publicly humiliated by him- lovely dinner parties in our trianon suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host's chair was vacant; a splash party at the new pool which i had built in the hope of keeping letch away from public beaches when letch and a certain aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour; a lovely epiphany party at errol flynn's on which sacred occasion letch stole away with an unknown starlet leaving me high and dry to get home as best i could
 these are but a sampling of the insults i endured 11
 as mrs letch feeley was it any wonder that i once the social arbiter of filmdom was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the astaires the coopers the gables the colmans the rathbones the taylors the thalbergs and such devout closely knit families as the barrymores and the crosbys? 4
  as letch's antisocial conduct increased our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever i played hostess at a fashionable screenland gathering
 between 1935 and 1939 letch and i made ten films together each less successful both artistically and commercially than the one before it
 our last joint venture sainted lady a deeply religious film based on the life of mother cabrini and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of america's first saint in november 1938 was a fiasco from start to finish
 as i was playing mother cabrini the picture was actually all mine with nearly every scene built around me
 but in order to keep letch in the public eye and out of trouble i wrote in a part especially for him- that of a dashing ruffian who sees the light and is saved by the inspiring example of mother cabrini 7
 and did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf? 8
  did he trouble to memorize the very small part which i had tailor-made to his specifications a role eventually cut down to three short speeches? 7
  did he show the rest of the cast- numbering four thousand- the consideration of arriving at the studio punctually- or even at all? 6
  he did not! the shooting went on for eight months! most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling bookies illegal gambling dens a certain residential club for young actresses more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club 5
 whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was hung over uncooperative rude and insulting
 he made many tasteless irreverent and unfunny remarks not only about me in the title role but about religion in general 8
 by the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about mother cabrini
 thanks to letch feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me the notices were few and unfavorable
 only george santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote: miss poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the protestant faith yet unleashed by hollywood 5
 but it was small consolation
 in a rare fit of anger and spite i farmed out my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment
 the film was called the diet of worms which i felt was just what letch deserved
 it turned out to be a life of martin luther of all things! it was a disaster! in clothes letch simply did not project 5
 he was laughed off the screen
 at the same time however i availed myself of the services of that great english actor and master of make-up sir gauntley pratt to do a quickie called the mystery of the mad marquess in which i played a young american girl who inherits a haunted castle on the english moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and unbeknownst to anyone is still occupied by an eccentric maniac 5
 it was a potboiler made on a shoestring and not the sort of film i like as all i had to do was look blank and scream a great deal 10
 my heart was not in it but oddly enough it remains the most financially successful picture of my caree r
 letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before
 i really loved that boy and in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful wonderful person letch had once been i took my troubles to momma hoping that her earthy advice would help me
 if i could only think of something at the studio near me to absorb his boundless energy i said
 what is letch interested in? 15
    bookies booze and babes momma said bluntly
 her reply stung me but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference
 i can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon i said
 up to date however his garden was still more or less of a mess he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it
 it wasn't his fault that these things were so 13
 the difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately
 as a result life had become a kind of continuous ma ke-ready 16
 once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention he could undertake the things which really counted 5
 then at last his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon accompanied by his dogs
 his dogs? 15
  he had almost forgotten them although they had played such an important part in his early dreams
 then they had always been romping around him on these walks yelping with delight dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws
 dogs did something to one's ego
 they were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys
 regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be you could be certain they would never find out- and even if they did it would make no difference
 now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture
 what in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on monday afternoons? 11
  you certainly couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns 6
 why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to? 10
    it worried him this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day
 he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it 23
 how in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business raise a family be on half a dozen boards work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case? 5
    was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed? 11
  could it be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with? 6
  or was the answer less metaphysical? 12
  did older people work more slowly? 9
  did it take a man of six ty-five longer to write a letter shave clean out a barn read a newspaper than a man of thirty? 7
  did men become perfectionists as they grew older polishing polishing reluctant to let go? 6
    it might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely like lizards in the sun too indolent to blink their eyes
 perhaps it was his misfortune or good fortune whichever way one looked at it to belong to the former group and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none which was positively antagonistic to it
 and then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement: reading roaming gardening lying on his back and watching the clouds go by was because he didn't want to do them
 there was no compulsion behind them
 they could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn 7
 during all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done
 this habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting
 he looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch 9
 it was five minutes after four
 on some distant farm a rooster crowed and far down the valley an associate answered
 he turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn
 at least he could buy the equipment for his workshop 8
 thus committed action might follow
 he went down to mills and bradley's hardware store and bought a full set of carpenter's tools including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that mr mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling whatever they were
 he also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools and lumber for his workbench sandpaper and glue and assorted nai ls levels and t squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for
 that'll get you started
 best not to get everything at once
 add things as you find you need 'em
 he didn't even ask the cost of this collection 13
 after all if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that
 when he returned home the station wagon loaded with tools jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village using the recently purchased second car
 it gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments
 he had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable
 he piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall
 that was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools
 in front of it would be his workbench
 the old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away
 how in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall? 8
  how did one attach anything to a stone wall for that matter? 7
  after the pegboard there would be the paneling 9
 he sat down on an old box and focused on the problem 9
 perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget
 but then when you stuck things into the holes why didn't they come right out again? 9
  it all seemed rather hopeless
 he turned his attention to the workbench
 perhaps that was the first thing to do
 a workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it? 6
    mr mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two- by-fours which properly handled would he had assured him turn into a workbench
 they lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile 12
 mr crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot
 how could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that? 12
  perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench- someone who knew what he was about 5
 then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on
 after that everything should be simpler
 he went upstairs to phone crumb
 to his amazement he reached him
 mr crumb was laid up with a bad cold
 he didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly
 the only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job
 that was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch 10
 no he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter
 there wasn't any such thing any more
 carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job
 there was a fellow named blatz over smithtown way 14
 nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk
 mr crumb would probably see him at lodge meeting the next night 6
 if he was sober which was doubtful he'd have him get in touch with mr crombie
 mr blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into mr crombie's life since he moved to highfield in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time and he didn't like to work at all unless mr crombie hung around and talked to him 4
 he said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you
 so mr crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep mr blatz's mind from funny things
 at the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls but mr blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance
 while mr blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench mr crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar
 mr blatz agreed that this would be pretty
 without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling which he then stained and waxed according to his taste 5
 now he said we got to put in some outlets for them power tools; then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' i guess we're about through down here
 it all did look very efficient and shipshape
 there was no question of that
 by the way said mr blatz packing his tools into a battered carrier them power tools needs extra voltage
 i guess you know about that
 before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits
 that ain't too bad 'ceptin' the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin'
 instead of being depressed by this news mr crombie was actually relieved
 at least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools
 he followed mr blatz up the cellar stairs
 as usual mrs crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils
 mr blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair 7
 well he said got your man fixed up nice down there 9
 he oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions
 mr crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression 10
 i was just sayin' to him that i'm all ready now for anything else you want done
 mr crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing 10
 oh that's wonderful cried mrs crombie
 i have a thousand things for you to do
 doors that won't open and doors that won't close and shelves and broken h   but those are the things i built the workshop for protested mr crombie
 those are the things i can do now that i'm set up 10
 i've been waiting to get these things done for months she said 6
 we won't live long enough if i wait for you besides which you don't need to worry- there'll be plenty more
 but the discussion was academic
 mr blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink
 nothing in english has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences 5
 ben franklin said clearly spoken mr fogg
 you explain english by greek
 richard brinsley sheridan said i think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two
 and a witty american journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning 5
 there are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology parisology and other ologies
 in common parlance they would be described as misses- misinterpreters misunderstanders misdirectors and kindred misdeeds 7
 one species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition
 did you or did you not say what i said you said because jane said you never said what i said? 5
    another woman addressing christmas cards said to her husband: we sent them one last year but they didn't send us one so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year don't you think or shall we? 5
    such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours
 ambiguity of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in
 i'm terribly upset she told a girl-friend
 i wrote bill in my last letter to forget that i had told him that i didn't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind- and he seems to have misunderstood me
 evidently bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women
 another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician
 mr jones you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement 5
 now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it? 8
    questions like this framed in verbal fog are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician 5
 they recall byron's classic comment: i wish he would explain his explanation
 similarly when a reporter once questioned lincoln in cryptic fashion lincoln refused to make any further statement 6
 i fear explanations explanatory of things explained he said leaving the biter bit- and bitter
 the obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks
 senator said an interviewer your constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question 7
 it took me five hours to write it that way
 the misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach
 this creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word
 a verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain: i saw a man once beat his wife when on a drunken spree
 now can you tell me who was drunk- the man his wife or me? 6
    the wooden-leg gag of vaudeville another standby of this sort had endless variations
 there's a man outside with a wooden leg named smith 3
 what's the name of his other leg? 8
    another stock vaudeville gag ran: mother is home sick in bed with the doctor
 when radio came in it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device
 do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on? 9
  i see the girl but i don't see the car with slacks on 6
 in recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline
 in one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman: excuse me but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter's handbag and my wife's behind
 journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips 6
 not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that snapshots must be of a person not larger than f inches 8
 classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions 6
 readers of the reader's digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips like the ad in a california paper that advertised house for rent
 view takes in five counties two bedrooms
 since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples 8
 many shapes in bathtubs
 son and daughter of local couple married
 apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter
 a weekly newspaper reported a local romance: h and the couple were married last saturday thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays
 an item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription adding: i personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband
 then there was the caterer's ad which read: are you getting married or having an affair? 8
  we have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people 12
 the newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical 11
 this slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous english always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say
 samples: he walked in upon her invitation
 she kissed him passionately upon his reappearance 9
 not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese
 in news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs
 while henry morgan was escorting miss vera green from the church social last saturday night a savage dog attacked them and bit mr morgan on the public square
 such items recall the california journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star: the area in which miss n- was injured is spectacularly scenic
 the double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device as in the gags of weber and fields 8
 when a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus he replied no it was in the stomach
 strangely enough this always brought the house down 8
 apart from journalese and vaudeville gags the anatomical is also found in jocular literature
 a conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor 10
 her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case
 it read: shot in the lumbar region
 after a moment of thought her mind cleared and in the interest of clarity she typed into the record: shot in the woods
 there are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations
 at the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving
 i want the fish served whole with head and tail the epicure explained and serve it with lemon in mouth
 that's silly- lemon in mouth she said
 but since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners the girl reluctantly agreed 10
 so she brought the fish in whole and she carried a lemon in her mouth
 another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store
 she said to the saleslady i want a dress to put on around the house
 the puzzled saleslady inquired how large is your house madam? 9
    this saleslady was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department
 when a customer asked for alligator shoes she said what size is your alligator? 8
  the comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy 6
 one species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person place time or thing
 a woman met a famous author at a literary tea
 oh i'm so delighted to meet you she gushed
 it was only the other day that i saw something of yours about something or other in some magazine
 this baffling lack of distinct details recalls the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence
 i may be back he explained and then again i may not 8
 yes sir she said is that definite? 15
    an old-fashioned mother said to her modern daughter you must have gotten in quite late last night dear
 where were you? 17
  the daughter replied oh i had dinner with- well you don't know him but he's awfully nice- and we went to a couple of places- i don't suppose you've heard of them- and we finished up at a cute little night club- i forget the name of it
 why it's all right isn't it mother? 12
  her woolly-minded parent agreed
 of course dear she said
 it's only that i like to know where you go
 no less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman's sermon
 dearly beloved he preached unless you repent of your sins in a measure and become converted to a degree you will i regret to say be damned to a more or less extent
 this clergyman should have referred to shakespeare's dictum: so-so is a good very good very excellent maxim
 and yet it is not
 indefinite reference also carries double-meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another
 a news item described the launching of a ship: completing the ceremony the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea 4
 this is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor pool: four trucks to fort mason gym 7:30 tonight for hauling girls to dance
 the bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off
 a politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died
 what are my chances for taking joe's place? 13
  he asked
 if you can fix it up with the undertaker returned the politician it's all right with me
 the manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite
 what have you got on today? 13
  she inquired
 a blue suit he answered
 who's in it? 13
  she continued
 there was a short pause for reflection
 oh said the woman i've seen that picture already 7
 another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb
 when a question contains two verbs the response does not make clear which of them is being answered
 the moonlit night was made for romance and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time
 finally he asked do you object to petting? 8
  that's one thing i've never done she said promptly 8
 he thought a moment then inquired you mean petted? 8
  no she smiled objected
 replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre
 it would be hard to find anything more equivocal than: i cannot recommend him too highly
 another less ambiguous case read as follows: the bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction 5
 if you are thinking of giving him a berth be sure to make it a wide one
 in the comedy of indefinite reference it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence
 ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference
 one said when i get a cold i buy a bottle of whiskey for it and within a few hours it's gone
 the speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold
 it-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit 7
 an excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone: doctor please come over right away
 my husband is in great pain
 i called the other afternoon on my old friend graves moreland the anglo-american literary critic- his mother was born in ohio- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the upson downs raising hell and peacocks the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing such as human stature hope and humor
 my unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed momentum weightlessness or distance from earth but is a matter of the development of the human mind 7
 after gagarin became the greatest man in the world for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism moreland wrote me a letter in which he said: i am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum or how far it can fly 8
 a bee's place is in the hive
 i have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy i told him at which he started slightly and then made us each a stiff drink with a trembling hand
 i seem to remember he said that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live
 did you go to their funeral? 10
    i was wrong i admitted
 comedy didn't die it just went crazy
 it has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate
 we now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes magazines known as horror comics and sick comedians
 there are even publications called sick and mad 16
 the zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a march hare; it is manic as a man
 i woke up this morning moreland said paraphrasing lewi s carroll
 do you want to hear the paraphrase? 24
    can i bear it? 12
  i asked taking a final gulp of my drink and handing him the empty glass
 just barely he said and repeated his paraphrase: the time has come the walrus said to speak of manic things of shots and shouts and sealing dooms of commoners and kings
 moreland fixed us each another drink and said for god's sake tell me something truly amusing
 i'll try i said and sat for a moment thinking
 oh yes the other day i reread some of emerson's english traits and there was an anecdote about a group of english and americans visiting germany more than a hundred years ago
 in the railway station at berlin a uniformed attendant was chanting 'foreigners this way! foreigners this way'! one woman- she could have been either english or american- went up to him and said 'but you are the foreigners'
 i took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink and said i admit that going back to ralph waldo emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy
 what's the matter with the music? 6
  moreland asked
 it doesn't drown out the dialogue i explained
 let's talk about books moreland said
 i am told that in america you have non-books by non-writers brought out by non-publishers for non-readers
 is it all non-fiction? 25
    there is non-fiction and non non-fiction i said 8
 speaking of nonism: the other day in a story about a sit-down demonstration the paris herald tribune wrote 'the non-violence became noisier'
 and then eichmann was quoted as saying in non-english that hitler's plan to exterminate the jews was nonsense 6
 if we cannot tell evil horror and insanity from nonsense what is the future of humor and comedy? 10
  moreland asked grimly
 they require for existence a brave spirit and a high heart and where do you find these? 7
  in our present era of science and angst the heart has been downgraded to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs 6
 i know what you mean moreland sighed
 last year your tennessee williams told our dilys powell in a television program that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart
 like almost everybody else he confused the heart both as organ and as symbol with the disturbed psyche the deranged glands and the jumpy central nervous system
 i'm not pleading for the heart that leaps up when it beholds a rainbow in the sky or for the heart that with rapture fills and dances with the daffodils
 the sentimental pure heart of galahad is gone with the knightly years but i still believe in the heart of the george meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks
 we no longer have tom moore's and longfellow's 'heart for any fate' either i said
 moore and longfellow didn't have the fate that faces us moreland said
 one day our species promises co-existence and the next day it threatens co-extinction
 we sat for a while drinking in silence
 the heart i said finally is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes
 when it was worn in the breast or even on the sleeve we at least knew where it was
 there was a long silence
 you have visited england five times in the past quarter-century i believe my host said
 what has impressed you most on your present visit? 6
    i would say depressed not impressed i told him 8
 i should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas involving clergymen and parishioners psychiatrists and patients
 it is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political arenas from the modern theatre
 do you think we need a new henry james to re-explore the anglo-american scene? 9
  he asked
 or perhaps a new noe^l coward? 9
    but you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of james and the antic heyday of coward
 i myself hear it said constantly- in drawing-rooms 10
 in them there is usually a group of anglo-americans with tragicomic problems worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire
 i stood up and began pacing
 if you are trying to get us out of the brothel the dustbin the kitchen sink and the tawdry living-room you are probably wasting your time moreland told me
 too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock
 furiouser and furiouser i said
 i am worried about the current meanings of the word 'funny' 10
 it now means ominous as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor; disturbing as when one says that a friend is acting funny; and frightening as when a wife tells the police that it is funny but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights
 moreland sat brooding for a full minute during which i made each of us a new drink
 he took his glass clinked it against mine and said toujours gai what the hell! borrowing a line from don marquis' mehitabel 7
 be careful of the word 'gay' for it too has undergone a change
 it now means in my country homosexual i said
 oh i forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance 5
 recently by the way i received a questionnaire in which i was asked whether or not i was non-institutionalized
 my host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks; then he turned to me
 is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species? 7
  oh that is demonstrable i told him
 do you remember the woman in the french alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously? 7
  she told the sheep 'the world is coming to an end'! and the sheep said- all in unison i have no doubt- 'ba-a-a'! the sound mockery of sheep is like the salubrious horse laugh
 that is only partly non-nonsense he began
 if you saw the drama called rhinoceros i said think of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros
 the rhinos would panic screaming 'help'!- if that can be screamed in their language
 you think the russians are getting ahead of us in comedy? 10
  moreland demanded
 the political and intellectual left began fighting humor and comedy years ago because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage such as satire and irony such as humor and comedy 5
 nevertheless like any other human being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually khrushchev the anti-personality cultist has become a comic actor or thinks he has 7
 in his famous meeting with nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as ed wynn
 but like caesar he has only one joke so far as i can find out 13
 it consists in saying 'that would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage'
 why in the name of his non-god doesn't he vary it a bit? 8
  such as? 12
  moreland asked
 such as 'sending the cat to guard the mice' or 'the falcon to protect the dove' or most terribly sharp of all 'the human being to save humanity'
 you and i have fallen out of literature into politics moreland observed
 what a nasty fall was there! i said
 moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again and then came back and sat down restively
 the world that was once foot-loose and fancy-free he said has now become screw-loose and frenzy-free
 in our age of science and angst it seems to me more brave to stay on earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space
 the human ego being what it is i put in science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats 5
 it seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species 11
 now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again moreland protested
 not in the largest sense of the words i said 16
 the other day arnold toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions its ideologies and its virtually everything else
 why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else? 7
  forty years ago an english writer w l george dealt with this subject in eddies of the day and said as an example that 'saint george for merry england' would not start a spirit half so quickly as 'strike frog-eating frenchmen dead'! there was also gott strafe angleterre moreland reminded me and carthago delenda est or if you will deus strafe carthage
 it isn't what the ideologist believes in but what he hates that puts the world in jeopardy
 this is the force in our time and in every other time that urges the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state 7
 complete power not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad 8
 there is a bitter satire for a future writer in that 14
 great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable i said
 but we now find writers obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and non-poetry
 i wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about
 one day the children had wanted to get up onto general burnside's horse
 they wanted to see what his back felt like- the general's 12
 he looked so comfortable being straight
 they wanted to touch the mystery
 arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by 6
 arlene had a hard voice too this time
 the policeman's eyes rather popped for a second; but then arlene got another tone in a hurry and she said if it wasn't for these dear children-
 the policeman got a confused funny look on his face and he had answered kind of politely now look here lady: i know you got to entertain these kids and all
 but this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on
 arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said yes sir
 the policeman walked on but he looked back once
 that had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred
 arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area; and they had told their mother about the tumbles 4
 in matters of exact information that kept her one step behind developments; and so they were consistently true to their principles 8
 never mind arlene had said after the policeman had left having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups
 i know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn
 what is it? 22
  asked the children whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable
 maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene
 just you wait advised arlene echoing the dialogue in a recent british movie
 and when they had got to their little lawn they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time
 first arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults 10
 they had protested that that wasn't any surprise 11
 just you wait said arlene again as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement
 is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal? 11
  asked one of the children
 not the least bit arlene snapped
 one of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously particularly your very very serious questions
 those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest
 she would sometimes even get a little hard on you she took you so seriously
 but not hard for very long
 just long enough to make you feel important 11
 now said arlene eventually making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable
 now we're going to be like what general burnside and his horse make us think of
 the children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever
 their curiosity went happily out of bounds
 then arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful
 she held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked
 imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home one of them said
 they both laughed and winked back
 i'm general burnside's horse upside down arlene said sort of gaspingly for her: even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position
 she made general burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down
 then she was back on her feet winking and smiling that enormous smile 
 and she would wink and throw kisses
 they both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time but it made their lips and eyelids tremble
 but they kept on clapping for a long long time 15
 this time arlene said and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking you're going to tell me what i am and what i'm doing
 it all has something to do with general burnside and his horse 9
 this time it was so grand; they could tell exactly what it was 8
 it was general burnside's horse running in a circle 15
 his legs shook and the shaking went right on up his body through his hips to his shoulders
 that's the general's horse one of them cried out 5
 the other remarked in a happy laughter that's a funny old horse
 the first one said he sure does shake
 then there was the general kissing his wife 21
 they had to be told that one
 but it was even funnier after they had been told 14
 their father when he came back from those many business trips just bumped their mother on the forehead with his lips and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis and put them in the electric icebox
 he was the funniest man
 he never could keep still even when he didn't move his feet 10
 then they had to get up and be general burnside 10
 all they could think of was to run around in circles kicking their legs out
 then they said general burnside was going to jump over his horse's head; and they did some somersaults
 but that wasn't very funny eithe r
 you ought to shake arlene advised them
 and arlene showed them how to begin
 she also taught them to sing i wish i could shimmy like my sister kate
 they were clumsy but they were beginning to catch on 11
 they also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling
 imagine you won't get your allowance if you're caught not smiling- or smiling with your lips trembling too much arlene suggested 6
 that helped a great deal
 they were a little late in getting home
 i'm sorry mrs minks arlene said in a tone so low you could hardly hear it
 my mother constituted herself the voice of all of us 9
 it's perfectly understandable arlene my mother said in a friendly way
 i suppose you all were playing and forgot? 13
  yes ma'am the children chorused heartily
 the children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters; and arlene began tapping the kitchen door open
 arlene's a good girl my uncle remarked to us; but he said it too soon for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded 5
 that tap had a slight bangish quality
 she really is a dear little thing my mother agreed 6
 her upper lip lifted slightly
 she was biting into a small red radish; and that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing 6
 also she lived in continual fear of finding a white worm curled up in a neat mean little heap at the white center of the radish 7
 she would try to see over the bulge of her cheeks and somewhat under her teeth to the place where she was biting
 it never worked naturally; but it made her look unusual 13
 also when she had bitten off half of the small radish she found the suspense unbearable; and she would snatch the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it
 one could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief 11
 actually it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it 7
 but the warm joy of her brown eyes was open to the general public
 later on the children told her further about somersaulting 9
 it must be awfully good for them
 and awfully kind of arlene she told us later
 but do you know something curious? 10
  she added
 i reached into that funny little pocket that is high up on my dress
 i have no notion why i reached
 and i found a radish
 was it an omen? 15
  i thought for a second
 but i would not pamper myself in that silly way 12
 i opened the window and threw the radish out 10
 then my mother blushed at this small lie; for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice that had made one more radish that night just too impossible a strain
 arlene became indispensable; nobody could have told why 9
 it was in the air
 a friend of my father's came to dinner
 he was passing through town and phoned to say hello 10
 as a result he was persuaded out to dinner
 as a matter of fact this happened every four or five months 13
 sometimes he coincided with my father's being at home 9
 sometimes as at this juncture he did not
 but he was always persuaded out
 he liked children in a loathsome kind of way; the two youngest in our family always had to be brought in and put through tricks for his entertainment
 when he had left i could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles laughingly with a thick index finger or whether he was merely so much the sort of person who did this that one assumed the action not bothering to look
 the children loathed him too
 this evening they were pushed in from the breakfast room with odds and ends of dessert distributed over them
 there had been some coconut in it for i remember my mother's taking a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of them and then putting down her radish with a shiver 6
 they were pushed gently into the room by arlene- whose only part appearing were hands that crept quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door
 we had just sat down
 tell mr gorboduc what you're doing these days my mother advised the children ceremonially
 there was an air of revolt about the children- even irreverence for their own principles
 this could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing a horselike balkiness of demeanor
 possibly the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration
 but at the beginning this stayed just in the air 17
 we go to the park with this nice lady one of them said 9
 this happy bulletin convulsed mr gorboduc
 you do? 25
  he asked between wheezes of laughter
 he was forced to wipe his eyes
 you don't step on the flowers do you? 7
  eh? 15
    one of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger
 mr gorboduc took a swig of his sherry
 he was so long thinking that my mother had time to inspect her sherry for dregs
 usually this was done when attention was diverted by someone else's long boring story
 but this time she was nervous: she was open
 mr gorboduc was finally in command of his mind again 7
 tell me- what do you do at the park? 10
  he asked
 this was delivered in a forthright way without coyness and over-pretended interest- an admirable way with children
 only unfortunately he could not remove from his voice a nagging insinuation of the direct command
 this nettled the children into the revelation of exact truth a sacrifice of their secret superiority over grown people but a victory in the wide fields of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment 6
 we bump one said; and the other went on to development of the idea 8
 we grind too he said
 my mother was beside herself with curiosity
 say that again she pleaded
 she laughed a little and tossed the dregs rakishly around in her glass
 you what? 32
  she could see that mr gorboduc was intrigued; the hostess in her took over
 you what? 32
    my uncle looked at mr gorboduc
 he read henry james and used to pretend profundity through eye-beamings at people
 he would not look up
 he was very funny about the whole thing
 a delightful vignette set in the unforgettable epoch of pre-punic war rome
 marcellus the hero is beset from all sides by the problems of approaching manhood

 an unusual if not extraordinary rendering of the classic myth that involves the rescue of prometheus from the rock by the us cavalry was given last week in the warehouse of the albany leather conduit company amid cheers of hubba hubba and yalagaloo pip pip! after a busy overture the curtain rises on a farm scene- the ranavan valley in northern maine
 a dead armadillo the sole occupant of the stage symbolizes the crisis and destruction of the old order
 old order acted and atonally sung by grunnfeu arapacis the lovely serbantian import then entered and delivered the well-known invocation to the god phineoppus whereupon the stage is quite unexpectedly visited by a company of wandering gorshek priests symbolizing love lust prudence and general motors respectively 4
 according to the myth old order then vanishes at stage left and reappears at extreme stage right but director shuz skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem of stage effects by simply having miss arapacis walk across the stage
 the night we saw it a rather unpleasant situation arose when the soloist refused to approach the armadillo complaining- in ad-lib- that it smelled
 we caught the early train to new york
 a list of highly unusual terms used in connection with eurasian proto-senility cults
 it's somewhat off the beaten track to be sure but therein lies its variety and charm
 for example probably very few people know that the word visrhanik that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb bouanahsha: to salivate
 likewise and equally fascinating is the news that such unlikely synonyms as pratakku sweathruna and the tongue-twister nnuolapertar- it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen all originated in the same village in bathar- on-walli province and are all used to express sentiments concerning british imperialism
 the terms are fairly safe to use on this side of the ocean but before you start spouting them to your date it might be best to find out if he was a member of major pockmanster's delhi regiment since resentment toward the natives was reportedly very high in that outfit 6
 the breeze and chancellor neitzbohr a movie melodrama that concerns the attempts of a west german politician to woo a plaster cast of the apollo belvedere
 as you have doubtless guessed already the plot is plastered with freudian jungian and meinckian theory
 for example when the film is only four minutes old neitzbohr refers to a small victorian piano stool as wilhelmina and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback that informs us that this very piano stool was once used by an epileptic governess whose name of course was doris 
 for the remainder of the movie chancellor neitzbohr proceeds to lash the piano stool with a slat from a venetian blind that used to hang in the pre-war reichstag
 in this manner he seeks to expunge from his own soul the guilt pangs caused by his personal assaults against the english at dunkirk 0
 as we find out at the end it is not the stool that he is punishing but the piece of venetian blind
 and when the slat finally shatters we see him count the fragments all the while muttering he loves me he loves me not
 after a few tortuous moments of wondering who he is the camera pans across the room to the plaster statue and we realize that neitzbohr is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece of sculpture 6
 the effect needless to say is almost terrifying and though at times a bit obscure the film is certainly a much-needed catharsis for the repressed movie-goer
 the music of bini salfininistas capital lp 63711-r one of the rare recordings of this titanic yet unsung composer 8
 those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the brest-silevniov festival in august 1916 will certainly welcome his return to public notice; and it is not unlikely that even as the great bach lay dormant for so many years so has the erudite ingenious salfininistas passed through his purgatory of neglect
 but now under the guidance of the contemporary composer marc schlek jr a major revival is under way
 as he leads the neurenschatz skolkau orchestra schlek gives a tremendously inspired performance of both the baslot and rattzhenfuut concertos including the controversial tschilwyk cadenza which was included at the conductor's insistence
 a major portion of the credit should also go to flautist haumd for his rendering of the almost impossible indianapolis movement in the baslot
 not only was haumd's intonation and phrasing without flaw but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity in stride 6
 for example to move from the lowest f-major register up to a barely audible n minor in four seconds not skipping at the same time even one of the 407 fingerings seems a feat too absurd to consider and it is to the flautist's credit that he remained silent throughout the passage
 we would have preferred however to have had the rest of the orchestra refrain from laughing at this and other spots on the recording since it mars an otherwise sober if not lofty performance 7
 as broadway itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite heavy-handed commercially successful musicals and inspirational problem dramas the american theatre is going through an inexorable renaissance in that nebulous area known as off-broadway
 for the last two years this frontier of the arts has produced a number of so-called non-dramas which have left indelible bittersweet impressions on the psyche of this veteran theatregoer
 the latest and significantly greatest fruit of this theatrical vine is the an adaptation of basho's classic frog-haiku by roger entwhistle a former university of maryland chemistry instructor 5
 although the play does show a certain structural amateurishness the statement it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning and searching of youth is profound and worthy of our attention 7
 the action centers about a group of outspoken and offbeat students sitting around a table in a cafeteria and their collective and ultimately fruitless search for a cup of hot coffee
 they are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides by a waitress the police and an intruding government tutor
 the innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them asking for a piece of lemon-meringue pie gets a plate of english muffins instead 6
 leaving the theatre after the performance i had a flash of intuition that life after all is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to happen to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired
 aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious interlude the story of a nymphomaniac trip-hammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel
 a biting pithy parable of the all-pervading hollowness of modern life the piece has been set by mlle lagoon to a sumptuous score by existentialist hot-shot jean-paul sartre
 petite lovely yvette chadroe plays the nymphomaniac engagingly
 ever since bambi and more recently born free there have been a lot of books about animals but few compare with max fink's wry understated charming and immensely readable my friend the quizzical salamander
 done in the modern style of a confession fink tells in exquisite detail how he came to know and more important love his mother's pet salamander alicia
 it is not an entirely happy book as mrs fink soon becomes jealous of alicia and in retaliation refuses to continue to scrape the algae off her glass
 max in a fit of despair takes alicia and runs off for two marvelous weeks in burbank  at the end of which alicia tragically contracts parkinson's disease and dies
 this brief resume hardly does the book justice but i heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems of our time
 opera in the grand tradition along with mah-jongg seems to be staging a well-deserved comeback
 in this country the two guiding lights are without doubt felix fing and anna pulova
 fing a lean chiseled impeccable gentleman of the old school who was once mistaken on the street for sir cedric hardwicke is responsible for the rediscovery of verdi's earliest most raucous opera nabisco a sumptuous bout- de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the mudugno version of volare 4
 miss pulova has a voice that maria callas once described as like chipping teeth with a screw driver and her round opalescent face becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions demanded by the role of rosalie
 the champs elysees is literally littered this summer with the prostrate bodies of france's beat-up beatnik jeunes filles 6
 cause of all this commotion: squat pug-nosed balding hopelessly ugly jean-pierre bravado a bogartian figure who plays a sadistic amoral philosophic tasti-freeze salesman in old new-waver fredrico de mille rossilini's endlessly provocative film a sour sponge
 bravado has been alternately described as a symbol of the new grandeur of france and myself and a decadent disgusting slob! but no one can deny that the screen crackles with electricity whenever he is on it
 soaring to stardom along with him margo felicity brighetti a luscious and curvaceously beguiling italian starlet turns in a creditable performance as an airplane mechanic
 the battle of the drib-drool continues but most of new york's knowing sophisticates of abstract expressionism are stamping their feet impatiently in expectation of v day september first when augustus quasimodo's first one-man show opens at the guggenheim 6
 we have heard that after seeing mr quasimodo's work it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity and importance of the whole abstract movement
 and it is thought by many who think about such things that quasimodo is the logical culmination of a school that started with monet progressed through kandinsky and the cubist picasso and blossomed just recently in pollock and de kooning 5
 quasimodo defines his own art as the search for what is not there 7
 i paint the nothing he said once to franz kline and myself the nothing that is behind the something the inexpressible unpaintable 'tick' in the unconscious the 'spirit' of the moment resting forever suspended like a huge balloon in non-time 5
 it is his relentlessness and unwaivering adherence to this revolutionary artistic philosophy that has enabled him to paint such pictures as the invasion of cuba
 in this work his use of non-color is startling and skillful 9
 the sweep of space the delicate counterbalance of the white masses the over-all completeness and unity the originality and imagination all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece 7
 i asked quasimodo recently how he accomplished this and he replied that he had painted his model a beautiful shade of red and then had her breathe on the canvas which was his typical tongue- in-cheek way of chiding me for my lack of sensitivity
 dear sirs: let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception in your minds wherever you are
 the collective by which i address you in the title above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term in use among professional thieves
 it is i am reliably given to understand the technical argot for those who engage in your particular branch of the boost; ie burglars who rob while the tenants are absent in contrast to hot-slough prowlers those who work while the occupants are home
 since the latter obviously require an audacity you do not possess you may perhaps suppose that i am taunting you as socially inferior 6
 far from it; i merely draw an etymological distinction hoping that specialists and busy people like you will welcome such precision in a layman
 above all disabuse yourselves of any thought that i propose to vent moral indignation at your rifling my residence to whimper over the loss of a few objets d'art or to shame you into rectitude 5
 my object rather is to alert you to an aspect or two of the affair that could have the gravest implications for you far beyond the legal sanctions society might inflict
 you have unwittingly set in motion forces so malign so vindictive that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them
 quite candidly fellows i wouldn't be in your shoes for all the rice in china
 as you've doubtless forgotten the circumstances in the press of more recent depredations permit me to recapitulate them briefly 6
 sometime on saturday evening august 22nd while my family and i were dining at the hostaria dell' orso in rome you jimmied a window of our home in bucks county pennsylvania and let yourselves into the premises
 hastening to the attic the temperature of which was easily hotter than the gold coast you proceeded to mask the windows with a fancy wool coverlet some khaki pants and the like and to ransack the innumerable boxes and barrels stored there
 what you were looking for eludes me but to judge from phonograph records scattered about a fumed-oak victrola you danced two tangos and a paso doble which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu 6
 you then descended one story glommed a television set from the music room- the only constructive feature of your visit by the way- and returning to the ground floor entered the master bedroom 6
 from the curio cabinet on its south wall and the bureaus beneath you abstracted seventeen ivory metal wood and stone sculptures of oriental and african origin two snuffboxes and a jade-handled magnifying glass
 rummaging through a stack of drawers nearby you unearthed an antique french chess set in ivory and sandalwood which along with two box kodaks you added to your haul
 then having wrapped the lot in an afghan my dog customarily slept on you lammed out the front door considerately leaving it open for neighbors to discover
 so much for the tiresome facts as familiar to you i'm sure as to the constables and state troopers who followed in your wake 6
 the foregoing aided by several clues i'll withhold to keep you on your toes will pursue you with a tenacity worthy of inspector javert but before they close in gird yourselves i repeat for a vengeance infinitely more pitiless
 fourteen of the sculptures you took posses properties of a most curious and terrifying nature as you will observe when your limbs begin to wither and your hair falls out in patches 4
 in time these minor manifestations will multiply and effloresce riddling you with frambesia the king's evil sheep rot and clonic spasm until your very existence becomes a burden and you cry out for release
 all this though is simply a prelude a curtain-raiser for what ensues and i doubt whether any occidental could accurately forecast it
 if however it would help to intensify your anguish i can delimit the powers of a few of the divinities you've affronted and describe the punishment they meted out in one analogous instance 8
 first of all the six figures of the budd ha you heisted- four siamese heads a black obsidian statuette in the earth-touching position and a large brass figure of the dying buddha on a teakwood base
 now you probably share the widespread western belief that the lord buddha is the most compassionate of the gods much more so than jehovah and allah and the rest
 'fess up- don't you? 10
  well ordinarily he is except toward impious folk who steal disturb or maltreat the presence
 very peculiar retribution indeed seems to overtake such jokers
 eight or ten years ago a couple of french hoods stole a priceless khmer head from the musee guimet in paris and a week later crawled into the salpetriere with unmistakable symptoms of leprosy 0
 hell's own amount of chaulmoogra oil did nothing to alleviate their torment; they expired amid indescribable fantods imploring the blessed one to forgive their desecration
 any reputable french interne can supply you with a dozen similar instances and i'll presently recount a case out of my own personal experience but for the moment let's resume our catalogue 6
 whether the pair of sudanese ivory carvings you lifted really possess the juju to turn your livers to lead as a dealer in khartoum assured me i am not competent to say
 likewise the ivory chinese female figure known as a doctor lady; a friend of mine removing her from the curio cabinet for inspection was felled as if by a hammer but he had previously drunk a quantity of applejack
 the three indian brass deities though- ganessa siva and krishna- are an altogether different cup of tea
 they hail from travancore a state in the subcontinent where kali the goddess of death is worshiped
 have you ever heard of thuggee? 17
  nuf sed h
 but it is the wooden sculpture from bali the one representing two men with their heads bent backward and their bodies interlaced by a fish that i particularly call to your attention
 oddly enough this is an amulet against housebreakers presented to the mem and me by a local rajah in 1949
 inscribed around its base is a charm in balinese a dialect i take it you don't comprehend
 neither do i but the tjokorda agoeng was good enough to translate and i'll do as much for you
 whosoever violates our rooftree the legend states can expect maximal sorrow
 the teeth will rain from his mouth like pebbles his wife will make him cocu with fishmongers and a trolley car will grow in his stomach 6
 furthermore- and this to me strikes an especially warming note- it shall avail the vandals naught to throw away or dispose of their loot
 the cycle of disaster starts the moment they touch any belonging of ours and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation 6
 sort of remorseless isn't it? 9
  still there it is
 now you no doubt regard the preceding as pap; you're tooling around full of gage in your hot rods gorging yourselves on pizza and playing pinball in the taverns and generally behaving like u^bermenschen
 in that case listen to what befell another wisenheimer who tangled with our joss
 a couple of years back i occupied a village apartment whose outer staircase contained the type of niche called a coffin turn 6
 in it was a stone tibetan buddha i had picked up in bombay and occasionally to make merit my wife and i garlanded it with flowers or laid a few pennies in its lap
 after a while we became aware that the money was disappearing as fast as we replenished it
 our suspicions eventually centered by the process of elimination on a grocer's boy a thoroughly bad hat who delivered cartons to the people overhead
 the more i probed into this young man's activities and character the less savory i found him
 i learned for example that he made a practice of yapping at dogs he encountered and in winter of sprinkling salt on the icy pavement to scarify their feet
 his energy was prodigious; sometimes he would be up before dawn clad as a garbage collector and hurling pails into areaways to exasperate us and thereafter would hurry to the bronx zoo to grimace at the lions and press cigar butts against their paws
 evenings he was frequently to be seen at restaurants like enrico + paglieri's or peter's backyard drunkenly donning ladies' hats and singing o sole mio
 in short and to borrow an arboreal phrase slash timber 8
 well the odious little toad went along chivying animals and humans who couldn't retaliate and in due course as was inevitable overreached himself
 one morning we discovered not only that the pennies were missing from the idol but that a cigarette had been stubbed out in its lap
 now he's bought it said my wife contentedly 11
 no divinity will hold still for that
 he's really asking for it
 and how right she was
 the next time we saw him he was a changed person; he had aged thirty years and his face the color of tallow was crisscrossed with wrinkles as though it had been wrapped in chicken wire 7
 some sort of nemesis was haunting his footsteps he told us in a quavering voice- either an ape specter or abe spector a process-server we couldn't determine which
 his eyes had the same dreadful rigid stare as dr grimesby roylott's when he was found before his open safe wearing the speckled band
 the grocery the youth worked for soon tired of his depressing effect on customers most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat of incubi and let him go
 the beautiful the satisfying part of his disintegration however was the masterly way the buddha polished him off
 reduced to beggary he at last got a job as office boy to a television producer
 his hubris deficiency of taste and sadism carried him straightaway to the top
 he evolved programs that plumbed new depths of bathos and besmirched whole networks and quickly superseded his boss 6
 not long ago i rode down with him in an elevator in radio city; he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen and smoking two cigars at once clearly a man in extremis
 see that guy? 17
  the operator asked pityingly
 i wouldn't be in his shoes for all the rice in china 7
 there's some kind of a nemesis haunting his footsteps 9
 however one looks at it therefore i'd say that your horoscope for this autumn is the reverse of rosy
 the inventory you acquired from me isn't going to be easy to move; you can't very well sidle up to people on the street and ask if they want to buy a hot bodhisattva
 additionally since you're going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue yaws delhi boil the granville wilt liver fluke bilharziasis and a host of other complications of the hex you've aroused you mustn't expect to be lionized socially
 my advice if you live long enough to continue your vocation is that the next time you're attracted by the exotic pass it up- it's nothing but a headache
 as you can count on me to do the same
 compassionately yours s j perelman the doors of the d train slid shut and as i dropped into a seat and exhaling looked up across the aisle the whole aviary in my head burst into song
 she was a living doll and no mistake- the blue-black bang the wide cheekbones olive-flushed that betrayed the cherokee strain in her midwestern lineage and the mouth whose only fault in the novelist's carping phrase was that the lower lip was a trifle too voluptuous 5
 from what i was able to gauge in a swift greedy glance the figure inside the coral-colored boucle dress was stupefying
